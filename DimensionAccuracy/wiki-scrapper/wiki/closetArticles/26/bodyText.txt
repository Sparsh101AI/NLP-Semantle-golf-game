Mad TV (stylized as MADtv) is an American sketch comedy television series originally inspired by Mad magazine.  In its initial run, it aired on Fox from 1995 to 2009.  After a one-off reunion show in 2015 to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the series, one more eight-episode season was produced and broadcast on The CW in 2016.
The series was based on MAD, a property owned by Time Warner Entertainment (parent of WB Television Distribution) through its DC Comics subsidiary. From the magazine, the show featured animated Spy vs. Spy and Don Martin shorts, as well as recurring images of longtime MAD mascot Alfred E. Neuman in earlier seasons, though the live-action sketches had no relation to the magazine's content.
The first broadcast was October 14, 1995. The one-hour show first-ran on Saturday nights on Fox.
MADtv was created by Fax Bahr and Adam Small. The series was originally produced by Bahr/Small Productions and Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment (QDE). After Bahr and Small left the series at the end of the third season (they were later credited as "executive consultants"), the series was handled by QDE and distributed by WB Television Distribution. The series was directed by Bruce Leddy (196 episodes), as well as David Grossman, and former Married...With Children cast member Amanda Bearse.
On November 12, 2008, Fox announced that the 14th season of MADtv would be its last on Fox.  David Salzman said that he would be exploring the continuation of the show on another channel, possibly cable. In early 2009, the show was moved to air after Talkshow with Spike Feresten, the show that normally followed MADtv, as a test, before being moved back. The series finale aired on May 16, 2009. The show was nominated for 35 Emmy Awards, winning seven.
On December 11, 2015, it was reported that MADtv would be returning for a one-hour special on The CW to celebrate the series' 20th anniversary; the special aired on January 12, 2016. A large portion of the original cast returned.
On April 11, 2016, The CW announced that it was reviving the show for an eight-episode season to air in primetime. The season premiered on July 26 and concluded on September 27, 2016. No further seasons were produced.
MADtv was taped in front of a live audience and consisted of sketches, cartoon shorts, and musical performances. Much of its comedy parodied popular television shows, movies and music, as well as topical, political, and pop culture humor.
Note:
Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released The Complete First Season of Mad TV in 2004. However, due to poor sales, the release of the second season was cancelled (despite a preview for it in the first season DVD). Mad TV: The Best of Seasons 8, 9, and 10 was released in 2005, featuring the most popular sketches from those seasons.
On November 5, 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series. They subsequently announced that they would release the second season on DVD on March 22, 2013. The third season was released on June 25, 2013 and the fourth season was released on November 12, 2013. As of 2020, the first four seasons of MADtv are the only seasons released on DVD, along with MADtv: The Best of Seasons 8, 9, and 10.
As of 2020, the FOX episodes of MADtv (from seasons 1 to 14) are now available on HBO Max. However, due to copyright and licensing issues involving some celebrity cameos and musical guests, some episodes have been skipped over (with seasons 5 through 10 having nearly all of their episodes missing while season 12 has only one episode missing and seasons 11, 13, and 14 are the only seasons to have every episode). Season 15 (the short-lived revival season on The CW) is also missing from the HBO Max release.
Originally, reruns of Mad TV aired as 30-minute reruns on local TV stations, often under the banner "The Best of Mad TV". The cable channel TNN (later Spike TV, now Paramount Network) aired the first six seasons of Mad TV from 2000 to 2003. Comedy Central soon picked up the show after its syndication package of Saturday Night Live reruns was acquired by the E! Entertainment Network, and aired 30-minute and full-hour reruns of episodes from seasons 1 through 11 until 2010. After Mad TVâ€™s run on Comedy Central, the show has not been on the air or had reruns in syndication since 2011, but Canada's CTV Comedy Channel also airs Mad TV reruns of seasons 8 through 13. In 2005, Canadian channel BiteTV began airing re-runs every weekday at 4pm.
On December 11, 2015, it was reported that the series would be returning for a one-hour special on The CW to celebrate the series' 20th anniversary; the special aired on January 12, 2016. A large portion of the original cast returned.
The CW announced that it was reviving the show for an eight-episode season to air in primetime on April 11, 2016, featuring a new cast. Some original cast members including Nicole Sullivan, Will Sasso, Bobby Lee, Aries Spears, Debra Wilson, Ike Barinholtz, Stephnie Weir and Anjelah Johnson returned as hosts, some of whom appeared as their signature characters or most memorable celebrity impressions.
