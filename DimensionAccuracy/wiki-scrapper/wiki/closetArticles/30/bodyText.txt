Ship watching is a form of outdoor activity and tourism that is carried out worldwide by observing the passage of various ships in the waterways where there is a lot of ship traffic.
In the United States, for example, ship watching is practised in Two Harbors, Minnesota, over Lake Superior, while in Japan, it is done on the ships that pass through the Uraga Channel at Kannonzaki Park, Kanagawa, Japan. In China, as many ships go up and down the Changjiang, River Bank Parks (Chinese: 江滩公园) in Hankou and in Wuchang, in the city of Wuhan, are good places to enjoy ship watching.
