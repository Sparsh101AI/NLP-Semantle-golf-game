The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series is an annual award given to the best television comedy series of the year. From 1960 to 1964, this category was combined with the Comedy Specials (one time programs) category so that both type of programs competed for the same award during those years.
The Flintstones and Family Guy are the only animated sitcoms to be nominated for the award. As of 2020, Fleabag (United Kingdom)  and Schitt's Creek (Canada) are the only shows from outside the United States to win this award.
The Big Three networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) have dominated the category. Only six other networks have won the award: HBO four times (once with Sex and the City and three times with Veep), Fox twice (with Ally McBeal and Arrested Development), Amazon Prime Video (with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), the BBC (with Fleabag; although seen later on Prime Video), Pop TV (with Schitt's Creek), and recently Apple TV+ (with Ted Lasso) each with one win.
