Expedition 67 is the 67th Long duration Expedition to the International Space Station. The Expedition began upon the departure of Soyuz MS-19 on 30 March 2022, with NASA astronaut Thomas Marshburn taking over as ISS commander. Initially, the Expedition consists of Marshburn and his three SpaceX Crew-3 crewmates Raja Chari, Kayla Barron and Matthias Maurer, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov, who launched aboard Soyuz MS-21 on 18 March 2022 and transfer from Expedition 66 alongside the Crew-3 astronauts. However, continued international collaboration has been thrown into doubt by the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions on Russia.
During Expedition 67 the space station was also visited by the crew of Axiom Mission 1, a space tourist mission that brought three spaceflight participants to the station on April 9, 2022 along with former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría. They departed the ISS on 25 April, 2022. 
Crew-3 are due to depart in late April, they should be replaced by SpaceX Crew-4, which is planned to ferry NASA astronauts Kjell N. Lindgren, Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins, as well as ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti to the station. Before returning Marshburn handed over the station command to Oleg Artemyev.
