The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc. (ABPN) is a not-for-profit corporation that was founded in 1934 following conferences of committees appointed by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Neurological Association, and the then "Section on Nervous and Mental Diseases" of the American Medical Association. This action was taken as a method of identifying qualified specialists in psychiatry and neurology. The ABPN is one of 24 member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties.
The Board of Directors consists of sixteen voting members. Elections to fill the places of members whose terms have expired take place annually. Neurology and psychiatry are always represented equally on the board. It is independently incorporated.
In addition to the specialties of psychiatry, neurology, and neurology with special qualification in child neurology, the ABPN (sometimes in collaboration with other member boards) has sought from the ABMS and gained approval for recognition of 15 subspecialties, as listed below:
addiction psychiatry
brain injury medicine
child and adolescent psychiatry
clinical neurophysiology
consultation-liaison psychiatry
epilepsy
forensic psychiatry
geriatric psychiatry
hospice and palliative medicine
