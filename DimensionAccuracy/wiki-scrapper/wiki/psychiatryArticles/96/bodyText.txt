The European Union Agency for Railways (ERA) is the agency of the European Union (EU) that sets mandatory requirements for European railways and manufacturers in the form of Technical Specifications for Interoperability, which apply to the Trans-European Rail system. The ERA publishes a document summarising the status of the TSIs. The ERA sets common safety targets, common safety methods and common safety indicators, following Directive 2004/49/EC and amendments. The ERA also hosts a number of databases, among which a register of remaining, applicable national rules.
The agency was established in 2004 as part of the Second Railway Package, and commenced operations in 2006 as the European Railway Agency (ERA). It changed its name in 2016, becoming the European Union Agency for Railways.
