The following is a timeline of Solar System astronomy.
3rd millennium BC - Around 5000 years ago, one of the Indian Sages, 'Maharshi Ved Vyas' composed a 'shloka' named "Nava-graha-stotram", in which he wrote in brief about the planets (except Uranus and Neptune) and the two states - Rahu and Ketu denote the points of intersection of the paths of the Sun and the Moon as they move on the celestial sphere. Rahu and Ketu are respectively called the north and the south lunar nodes.
2nd millennium BC – earliest possible date for the composition of the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet Venus, and the oldest planetary table currently known.
2nd millennium BC – Babylonian astronomers identify the inner planets Mercury and Venus and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, which would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.

c. 450 BC: Anaxagoras shows that the Moon shines by reflected sunlight.
350 BC – Aristotle argues for a spherical Earth using lunar eclipses and other observations
280 BC – Aristarchus of Samos offers the first definite discussion of the possibility of a heliocentric cosmos, and uses the size of the Earth's shadow on the Moon to estimate the Moon's orbital radius at 60 Earth radii, and its physical radius as one-third that of the Earth. He also makes an inaccurate attempt to measure the distance to the Sun
200 BC – Eratosthenes determines that the radius of the Earth is roughly 6,400 km
150 BC – Hipparchus uses parallax to determine that the distance to the Moon is roughly 380,000 km

1150 – Indian mathematician-astronomer Bhāskara II, in the Siddhanta Shiromani, calculates the longitudes and latitudes of the planets, lunar and solar eclipses, risings and settings, the Moon's lunar crescent, syzygies, and conjunctions of the planets with each other and with the fixed stars, and explains the three problems of diurnal rotation
1150s – Bhaskara calculates the planetary mean motion, ellipses, first visibilities of the planets, the lunar crescent, the seasons, and the length of the Earth's revolution around the Sun to 9 decimal places.
1150s – Gerard of Cremona translates Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic into Latin.
c. 1200 – Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, in dealing with his conception of physics and the physical world, rejected the Aristotelian and Avicennian view of a single world, but instead proposed that there are "a thousand thousand worlds (alfa alfi 'awalim) beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has."
c. 1300 – Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, in his criticism of astrology, recognized that the stars are much larger than the planets, and that Mercury is the smallest planet known to him.

1577 – Tycho Brahe uses parallax to prove that comets are distant entities and not atmospheric phenomena.
1584 – Giordano Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (La Cena de le Ceneri and De l'infinito universo et mondi) in which he argued against the planetary spheres and affirmed the Copernican principle. Bruno's infinite universe was filled with a substance—a "pure air", aether, or spiritus—that offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which, in Bruno's view, rather than being fixed, moved under their own impetus (momentum). Most dramatically, he completely abandoned the idea of a hierarchical universe. Bruno's cosmology distinguishes between "suns" which produce their own light and heat, and have other bodies moving around them; and "earths" which move around suns and receive light and heat from them. Bruno suggested that some, if not all, of the objects classically known as fixed stars are in fact suns, so he was arguably the first person to grasp that "stars are other suns with their own planets." Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different from that of our Earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".1604 – Galileo Galilei correctly hypothesized that the distance of a falling object is proportional to the square  of the time elapsed.
1609 – Johannes Kepler states his first two empirical laws of planetary motion, stating that the orbits of the planets are elliptical rather than circular, and thus resolving many ancient problems with planetary models.
1609 – Galileo Galilei starts to make telescopes with about 3x up to 30x magnification, based only on descriptions of the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the Earth—what is commonly known as a spyglass—but also it can be used to observe the sky, a key tool for further astronomical discoveries.
1609 – Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at the Moon. While not being the first person to observe the Moon through a telescope (English mathematician Thomas Harriot had done it four months before but only saw a "strange spottednesse"), Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. He also estimated the heights of that mountains. The Moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first "planet".
1610 – Galileo Galilei discovers the main moons of Jupiter: Callisto, Europa, Ganymede, and Io; sees Saturn's planetary rings (but does not recognize that they are rings), and observes the phases of Venus, disproving the Ptolemaic system though not the geocentric model.
