Kipini is an impact crater in the Oxia Palus quadrangle of Mars.  It was named by the IAU in 1976 after Kipini, a town in Kenya.
Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits.  As craters get larger (greater than 10Â km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Kipini does not have a central peak and it is presumed to be buried by younger deposits.  If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios. Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.
Kipini is north of the smaller crater Lydda.  Both lie on an "island" which divided the Tiu Valles, an outflow channel that carried water from the highlands in the south to the lowlands of Chryse Planitia.
