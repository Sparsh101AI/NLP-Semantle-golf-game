State of the Union, branded as State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, is an American Sunday talk show and political discussion television program co-anchored by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash on CNN and broadcast around the world by CNN International. It has been broadcast since its debut in January 2009.
The program is broadcast from 9:00 am to 10:00 am ET, with a replay at noon to 1:00 pm ET from CNN's studios in Washington D.C.
The program premiered on January 18, 2009, originally with John King as host, and aired from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm ET (though only the 9:00 am and noon ET hours are simulcast on CNN International) and from 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm ET. It features news analysis and interviews with politicians, reporters, and newsmakers, as well as the "Magic Wall", an interactive touch screen map previously used by King to cover the 2008 presidential election. At four hours long, it was by far the longest of the Sunday talk shows. It was created as a merger between Reliable Sources and Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer; Reliable Sources continued unchanged as a one-hour "segment" of State of the Union. On February 11, 2009, CNN announced it had hired former Meet the Press producer Michelle Jaconi as the executive producer of the program.
On a January 31, 2010, broadcast, John King announced that senior political correspondent Candy Crowley would become the new anchor of the program, following King's move to take over Lou Dobbs' former timeslot. In the move, the program was cut from four hours to one, and the Reliable Sources "show within a show" was spun off once again as its own program.
In January 2021, CNN announced that Dana Bash would join Tapper as a co-host. The two will alternate Sundays hosting.
