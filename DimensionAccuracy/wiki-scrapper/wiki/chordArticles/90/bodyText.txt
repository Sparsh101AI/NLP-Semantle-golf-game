In calculus, the general Leibniz rule, named after Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, generalizes the product rule (which is also known as "Leibniz's rule").  It states that if 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 and 



g


{\displaystyle g}

 are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-times differentiable functions, then the product 



f
g


{\displaystyle fg}

 is also 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-times differentiable and its 



n


{\displaystyle n}

th derivative is given by




(
f
g

)

(
n
)


=

∑

k
=
0


n





(


n
k


)




f

(
n
−
k
)



g

(
k
)


,


{\displaystyle (fg)^{(n)}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)},}

where 






(


n
k


)



=



n
!


k
!
(
n
−
k
)
!





{\displaystyle {n \choose k}={n! \over k!(n-k)!}}

 is the binomial coefficient and 




f

(
j
)




{\displaystyle f^{(j)}}

 denotes the jth derivative of f (and in particular 




f

(
0
)


=
f


{\displaystyle f^{(0)}=f}

).
The rule can be proved by using the product rule and mathematical induction.
If, for example, n = 2, the rule gives an expression for the second derivative of a product of two functions:




(
f
g

)
″

(
x
)
=

∑

k
=

.


{\displaystyle (fg)''(x)=\sum \limits _{k=0}^{2}{{\binom {2}{k}}f^{(2-k)}(x)g^{(k)}(x)}=f''(x)g(x)+2f'(x)g'(x)+f(x)g''(x).}

The formula can be generalized to the product of m differentiable functions f1,...,fm.

where the sum extends over all m-tuples (k1,...,km) of non-negative integers with

{\displaystyle \sum _{t=1}^{m}k_{t}=n,}

{\displaystyle {n \choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots ,k_{m}}={\frac {n!}{k_{1}!\,k_{2}!\cdots k_{m}!}}}

are the multinomial coefficients. This is akin to the multinomial formula from algebra.
The proof of the general Leibniz rule proceeds by induction.  Let 



f


{\displaystyle f}

 and 



g


{\displaystyle g}

 be 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-times differentiable functions.  The base case when 



n
=
1


{\displaystyle n=1}

 claims that:




(
f
g

)
′

=

f
′

g
+
f

g
′

,


{\displaystyle (fg)'=f'g+fg',}

which is the usual product rule and is known to be true.  Next, assume that the statement holds for a fixed 



n
≥
1
,


{\displaystyle n\geq 1,}

 that is, that




(
f

n

{\displaystyle (fg)^{(n)}=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)}.}

Then,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}(fg)^{(n+1)}&=\left[\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k)}\right]'\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n-k)}g^{(k+1)}\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n+1}{\binom {n}{k-1}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}\\&={\binom {n}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n}{k-1}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+{\binom {n}{n}}fg^{(n+1)}\\&={\binom {n+1}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g+\left(\sum _{k=1}^{n}\left[{\binom {n}{k-1}}+{\binom {n}{k}}\right]f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}\right)+{\binom {n+1}{n+1}}fg^{(n+1)}\\&={\binom {n+1}{0}}f^{(n+1)}g+\sum _{k=1}^{n}{\binom {n+1}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}+{\binom {n+1}{n+1}}fg^{(n+1)}\\&=\sum _{k=0}^{n+1}{\binom {n+1}{k}}f^{(n+1-k)}g^{(k)}.\end{aligned}}}

And so the statement holds for 



n
+
1
,


{\displaystyle n+1,}

 and the proof is complete.
With the multi-index notation for partial derivatives of functions of several variables, the Leibniz rule states more generally:





∂

α


(
f
g
)
=

∑

β

:

β
≤
α





(


α
β


)



(

∂

β


f
)
(

∂

α
−
β


g
)
.


{\displaystyle \partial ^{\alpha }(fg)=\sum _{\beta \,:\,\beta \leq \alpha }{\alpha  \choose \beta }(\partial ^{\beta }f)(\partial ^{\alpha -\beta }g).}

This formula can be used to derive a formula that computes the symbol of the composition of differential operators. In fact, let P and Q be differential operators (with coefficients that are differentiable sufficiently many times) and 



R
=
P
∘
Q
.


{\displaystyle R=P\circ Q.}

 Since R is also a differential operator, the symbol of R is given by:




R
(
x
,
ξ
)
=

e

−

⟨
x
,
ξ
⟩



R
(

e

⟨
x
,
ξ
⟩


)
.


{\displaystyle R(x,\xi )=e^{-{\langle x,\xi \rangle }}R(e^{\langle x,\xi \rangle }).}

A direct computation now gives:




R
(
x
,
ξ
)
=

∑

α




1

α
!





(


∂

∂

)


α


P
(
x
,
ξ
)


(


∂

∂
x



)


α


Q
(
x
,
ξ
)
.


{\displaystyle R(x,\xi )=\sum _{\alpha }{1 \over \alpha !}\left({\partial  \over \partial \xi }\right)^{\alpha }P(x,\xi )\left({\partial  \over \partial x}\right)^{\alpha }Q(x,\xi ).}

This formula is usually known as the Leibniz formula. It is used to define the composition in the space of symbols, thereby inducing the ring structure.
