In mathematics, a quartic equation is one which can be expressed as a quartic function equaling zero. The general form of a quartic equation is




a

x

4


+
b

x

3


+
c

x

2


+
d
x
+
e
=
0



{\displaystyle ax^{4}+bx^{3}+cx^{2}+dx+e=0\,}

where a ≠ 0.
The quartic is the highest order polynomial equation that can be solved by radicals in the general case (i.e., one in which the coefficients can take any value).
Lodovico Ferrari is attributed with the discovery of the solution to the quartic in 1540, but since this solution, like all algebraic solutions of the quartic, requires the solution of a cubic to be found, it couldn't be published immediately. The solution of the quartic was published together with that of the cubic by Ferrari's mentor Gerolamo Cardano in the book Ars Magna (1545).
The proof that this was the highest order general polynomial for which such solutions could be found was first given in the Abel–Ruffini theorem in 1824, proving that all attempts at solving the higher order polynomials would be futile.  The notes left by Évariste Galois before his death in a duel in 1832 later led to an elegant complete theory of the roots of polynomials, of which this theorem was one result.
Consider a quartic equation expressed in the form 




a

{\displaystyle a_{0}x^{4}+a_{1}x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x+a_{4}=0}

:
There exists a general formula for finding the roots to quartic equations, provided the coefficient of the leading term is non-zero. However, since the general method is quite complex and susceptible to errors in execution, it is better to apply one of the special cases listed below if possible.
If the constant term a4 = 0, then one of the roots is x = 0, and the other roots can be found by dividing by x, and solving the resulting cubic equation,





a

0



x

3


+

a

x

+

a

2


x
+

a

3


=
0.



{\displaystyle a_{0}x^{3}+a_{1}x^{2}+a_{2}x+a_{3}=0.\,}

Call our quartic polynomial Q(x). Since 1 raised to any power is 1, 



Q
(
1
)
=

a

0


+

a

1


+

a

2


+

a

3


+

a

4




{\displaystyle Q(1)=a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}}

. Thus if 




a

0


+

a

1


+

a

2


+

a

3


+

a

4


=
0


{\displaystyle a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}=0}

, Q(1) = 0 and so x = 1 is a root of Q(x).  It can similarly be shown that if 




a

0


+

a

2


+

a

4


=

a

1


+

a

3




{\displaystyle a_{0}+a_{2}+a_{4}=a_{1}+a_{3}}

, x = −1 is a root.
In either case the full quartic can then be divided by the factor (x − 1) or (x + 1) respectively yielding a new cubic polynomial, which can be solved to find the quartic's other roots.
If 




a

1


=

a

0


k


{\displaystyle a_{1}=a_{0}k}

, 




a

2


=
0


{\displaystyle a_{2}=0}

 and 




a

4


=

a

3


k


{\displaystyle a_{4}=a_{3}k}

, then x = −k is a root of the equation.  The full quartic can then be factorized this way:





a

0



x

4


+

a

0


k

x

3


+

a

x
+

a

k
=

(

(

)
=
(

0



x

+

a

)
(
x
+
k
)
.



{\displaystyle a_{0}x^{4}+a_{0}kx^{3}+a_{3}x+a_{3}k=a_{0}x^{3}(x+k)+a_{3}(x+k)=(a_{0}x^{3}+a_{3})(x+k).\,}

If 




a

1


=

a

0


k


{\displaystyle a_{1}=a_{0}k}

 , 




a

3


=

a

2


k


{\displaystyle a_{3}=a_{2}k}

  and  




a

4


=
0


{\displaystyle a_{4}=0}

, x = 0 and x = −k are two known roots.  Q(x) divided by x(x + k) is a quadratic polynomial.
A quartic equation where a3 and a1 are equal to 0 takes the form





a

0



x

4


+

a

2



x

2


+

a

4


=
0




{\displaystyle a_{0}x^{4}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}=0\,\!}

and thus is a biquadratic equation, which is easy to solve: let 



z
=

x

2




{\displaystyle z=x^{2}}

, so our equation turns to





a

0



z

2


+

a

2


z
+

a

4


=
0




{\displaystyle a_{0}z^{2}+a_{2}z+a_{4}=0\,\!}

which is a simple quadratic equation, whose solutions are easily found using the quadratic formula:




z
=



−

a

2


±



a

2


−
4

a

0



a

4






2

a

0









{\displaystyle z={\frac {-a_{2}\pm {\sqrt {a_{2}^{2}-4a_{0}a_{4}}}}{2a_{0}}}\,\!}

When we've solved it (i.e. found these two z values), we can extract x from them





x

1


=
+



z

+








{\displaystyle x_{1}=+{\sqrt {z_{+}}}\,\!}







x

2


=
−



z

+








{\displaystyle x_{2}=-{\sqrt {z_{+}}}\,\!}







x

3


=
+



z

−








{\displaystyle x_{3}=+{\sqrt {z_{-}}}\,\!}







x

4


=
−



z

−








{\displaystyle x_{4}=-{\sqrt {z_{-}}}\,\!}

If either of the z solutions were negative or complex numbers, then some of the x solutions are complex numbers.

Steps:
Divide by x.
Use variable change z = x + m/x.If the quartic has a double root, it can be found by taking the polynomial greatest common divisor with its derivative. Then they can be divided out and the resulting quadratic equation solved.
To begin, the quartic must first be converted to a depressed quartic.
Let

E

=

{\displaystyle x^{4}+{B \over A}x^{3}+{C \over A}x^{2}+{D \over A}x+{E \over A}=0.}

The first step should be to eliminate the x term. To do this, change variables from x to u, such that




x
=
u
−


B

.


{\displaystyle x=u-{B \over 4A}.}

Then

Expanding the powers of the binomials produces

{\displaystyle \left(u^{4}-{B \over A}u^{3}+{6u^{2}B^{2} \over 16A^{2}}-{4uB^{3} \over 64A^{3}}+{B^{4} \over 256A^{4}}\right)+{B \over A}\left(u^{3}-{3u^{2}B \over 4A}+{3uB^{2} \over 16A^{2}}-{B^{3} \over 64A^{3}}\right)+{C \over A}\left(u^{2}-{uB \over 2A}+{B^{2} \over 16A^{2}}\right)+{D \over A}\left(u-{B \over 4A}\right)+{E \over A}=0.}

Now rename the coefficients of u. Let

The resulting equation is

which is a depressed quartic equation.
If 



β
=
0
 


{\displaystyle \beta =0\ }

 then we have a biquadratic equation, which (as explained above) is easily solved. The general solution will not work if β=0.
In either case, substituting the values found for u into




x
=
u
−


B

4
A





{\displaystyle x=u-{B \over 4A}}

yields the values for x.
After converting to a depressed quartic equation





x

4


+
a

x

2


+
b
x
+
c
=
0


{\displaystyle x^{4}+ax^{2}+bx+c=0}

and eliminating the special case when b=0, we assume that b≠0 hereafter. We will separate the terms as





x

4


=
−
a

x

2


−
b
x
−
c


{\displaystyle x^{4}=-ax^{2}-bx-c}

and add terms to both sides which make them both into squares.
Let y be any solution of this cubic equation:

(

=
0


{\displaystyle 2y^{3}-ay^{2}-2cy+(ac-{\tfrac {1}{4}}b^{2})=(2y-a)(y^{2}-c)-{\tfrac {1}{4}}b^{2}=0}

.Then (using b≠0)




2
y
−
a
≠
0


{\displaystyle 2y-a\neq 0}

so we may divide by it, giving





y

−
c
=

4
(
2
y
−

)





{\displaystyle y^{2}-c={\frac {b^{2}}{4(2y-a)}}}

.Then

{\displaystyle (x^{2}+y)^{2}=x^{4}+2yx^{2}+y^{2}=(2y-a)x^{2}-bx+(y^{2}-c)=(2y-a)x^{2}-bx+{\frac {b^{2}}{4(2y-a)}}=\left({\sqrt {2y-a}}\,x-{\frac {b}{2{\sqrt {2y-a}}}}\right)^{2}}

.Subtracting, we get the difference of two squares which is the product of the sum and difference of their roots

{\displaystyle (x^{2}+y)^{2}-\left({\sqrt {2y-a}}\,x-{\frac {b}{2{\sqrt {2y-a}}}}\right)^{2}=\left(x^{2}+{\sqrt {2y-a}}\,x+y-{\frac {b}{2{\sqrt {2y-a}}}}\right)\left(x^{2}-{\sqrt {2y-a}}\,x+y+{\frac {b}{2{\sqrt {2y-a}}}}\right)=0}

which can be solved by applying the quadratic formula to each of the two factors. So the possible values of x are:

{\displaystyle x={\tfrac {1}{2}}\left({\sqrt {2y-a}}-{\sqrt {-2y-a-{\frac {2b}{\sqrt {2y-a}}}}}\right)}

.Using another y from among the three roots of the cubic simply causes these same four values of x to appear in a different order. The solutions of the cubic are:




y
=

{\displaystyle y={\frac {a}{6}}+w-{\frac {p}{3w}}}

{\displaystyle q=-{\frac {a^{3}}{108}}+{\frac {ac}{3}}-{\frac {b^{2}}{8}}}

.Otherwise, the depressed quartic can be solved by means of a method discovered by Lodovico Ferrari. Once the depressed quartic has been obtained, the next step is to add the valid identity

)


2


−

−

{\displaystyle \left(u^{2}+\alpha \right)^{2}+\beta u+\gamma =\alpha u^{2}+\alpha ^{2}.}







 

 

 



 



(2)
The effect has been to fold up the u term into a perfect square: (u + α). The second term, αu did not disappear, but its sign has changed and it has been moved to the right side.
The next step is to insert a variable y into the perfect square on the left side of equation (2), and a corresponding 2y into the coefficient of u in the right side. To accomplish these insertions, the following valid formulas will be added to equation (2),








(

u

2

y

)

2

and

−

y

u

{\displaystyle 0=(\alpha +2y)u^{2}-2yu^{2}-\alpha u^{2}\,}

These two formulas, added together, produce

which added to equation (2) produces

{\displaystyle \left(u^{2}+\alpha +y\right)^{2}+\beta u+\gamma =\left(\alpha +2y\right)u^{2}+\left(2y\alpha +y^{2}+\alpha ^{2}\right).\,}

This is equivalent to

.


{\displaystyle (u^{2}+\alpha +y)^{2}=(\alpha +2y)u^{2}-\beta u+(y^{2}+2y\alpha +\alpha ^{2}-\gamma ).}







 

 

 



 



(3)
The objective now is to choose a value for y such that the right side of equation (3) becomes a perfect square. This can be done by letting the discriminant of the quadratic function become zero. To explain this, first expand a perfect square so that it equals a quadratic function:






(

s
u
+
t

)


2


=

(

s

2


)


u

2


+

(

2
s
t

)

u
+

(

t

2


)

.



{\displaystyle \left(su+t\right)^{2}=\left(s^{2}\right)u^{2}+\left(2st\right)u+\left(t^{2}\right).\,}

The quadratic function on the right side has three coefficients. It can be verified that squaring the second coefficient and then subtracting four times the product of the first and third coefficients yields zero:






(

2
s
t

)


2


−
4

(

s

2


)


(

t

2


)

=
0.



{\displaystyle \left(2st\right)^{2}-4\left(s^{2}\right)\left(t^{2}\right)=0.\,}

Therefore to make the right side of equation (3) into a perfect square, the following equation must be solved:




(
−
β

)

2


−
4

(

2
y
+
α

)


(


y

2

α

2


−
γ

)

=
0.



{\displaystyle (-\beta )^{2}-4\left(2y+\alpha \right)\left(y^{2}+2y\alpha +\alpha ^{2}-\gamma \right)=0.\,}

Multiply the binomial with the polynomial,





β

(

=

{\displaystyle \beta ^{2}-4\left(2y^{3}+5\alpha y^{2}+\left(4\alpha ^{2}-2\gamma \right)y+\left(\alpha ^{3}-\alpha \gamma \right)\right)=0\,}

Divide both sides by −4, and move the −β/4 to the right,

This is a cubic equation in y. Solve for y using any method for solving such equations (e.g. conversion to a reduced cubic and application of Cardano's formula). Any of the three possible roots will do.
With the value for y so selected, it is now known that the right side of equation (3) is a perfect square of the form

Equation (5) has a pair of folded perfect squares, one on each side of the equation. The two perfect squares balance each other.

The two ±s must have the same sign, the ±t is independent. To get all roots, compute x for ±s,±t = +,+ and for +,−; and for −,+ and for −,−. This formula handles repeated roots without problem.Ferrari was the first to discover one of these labyrinthine solutions. The equation which he solved was

=

{\displaystyle x^{4}+6x^{2}-60x+36=0}

which was already in depressed form. It has a pair of solutions which can be found with the set of formulas shown above.
If the coefficients of the quartic equation are real then the nested depressed cubic equation (5) also has real coefficients, thus it has at least one real root.
Furthermore the cubic function




C
(
v
)
=

v

+
P
v
+
Q
,


{\displaystyle C(v)=v^{3}+Pv+Q,}

where P and Q are given by (5) has the properties that

 and




lim

v
→
∞


C
(
v
)
=
∞
,


{\displaystyle \lim _{v\to \infty }C(v)=\infty ,}


where α and β are given by (1).
This means that (5) has a real root greater than 




α

3


{\displaystyle \alpha  \over 3}

,
and therefore that (4) has a real root greater than 




−
α

2


{\displaystyle -\alpha  \over 2}

.
Using this root the term 





α
+
2
y




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\alpha +2y}}}

 in (8) is always real,
which ensures that the two quadratic equations (8) have real coefficients.
It could happen that one only obtained one solution through the formulae above, because not all four sign patterns are tried for four solutions, and the solution obtained is complex. It may also be the case that one is only looking for a real solution. Let x1 denote the complex solution. If all the original coefficients A, B, C, D and E are real—which should be the case when one desires only real solutions – then there is another complex solution x2 which is the complex conjugate of x1. If the other two roots are denoted as x3 and x4 then the quartic equation can be expressed as

One of these two solutions should be the desired real solution.
Most textbook solutions of the quartic equation require a magic substitution that is almost impossible to memorize. Here is a way to approach it that makes it easy to understand.

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}0&=x^{4}+bx^{3}+cx^{2}+dx+e\\&=\left(x^{2}+px+q\right)\left(x^{2}+rx+s\right)\\&=x^{4}+(p+r)x^{3}+(q+s+pr)x^{2}+(ps+qr)x+qs\end{aligned}}}

By equating coefficients, this results in the following set of simultaneous equations:

This is harder to solve than it looks, but if we start again with a depressed quartic where 



b
=
0


{\displaystyle b=0}

, which can be obtained by substituting 



(
x
−
b

/

)


{\displaystyle (x-b/4)}

 for 



x


{\displaystyle x}

, then

 by doing the following:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(c+p^{2}\right)^{2}-(d/p)^{2}&=(s+q)^{2}-(s-q)^{2}\\&=4sq\\&=4e\end{aligned}}}

If we set 



P
=

{\displaystyle P=p^{2}}

, then this equation turns into the cubic equation:

{\displaystyle P^{3}+2cP^{2}+\left(c^{2}-4e\right)P-d^{2}=0}

which is solved elsewhere.  Once you have

The symmetries in this solution are easy to see.  There are three roots of the cubic, corresponding to the three ways that a quartic can be factored into two quadratics, and choosing positive or negative values of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 for the square root of 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 merely exchanges the two quadratics with one another.
The symmetric group S4 on four elements has the Klein four-group as a normal subgroup. This suggests using a resolvent whose roots may be variously described as a discrete Fourier transform or a Hadamard matrix transform of the roots.

then since the transformation is an involution, we may express the roots in terms of the four si in exactly the same way. Since we know the value s0 = −b/2, we really only need the values for s1, s2 and s3. These we may find by expanding the polynomial

This polynomial is of degree six, but only of degree three in z, and so the corresponding equation is solvable. By trial we can determine which three roots are the correct ones, and hence find the solutions of the quartic.
We can remove any requirement for trial by using a root of the same resolvent polynomial for factoring; if w is any root of (3), and if

We therefore can solve the quartic by solving for w and then solving for the roots of the two factors using the quadratic formula.
The methods described above are, in principle, exact methods which find the roots once and for all. It is also possible to use methods which give successive approximations which hopefully improve with each iteration. Once such method is the Durand–Kerner method. Such methods may be the only ones available, other than special cases, when trying to solve quintic and higher equations.
