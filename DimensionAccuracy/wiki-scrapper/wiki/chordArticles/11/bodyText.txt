In the mathematical field of functional analysis, Banach spaces are among the most important objects of study.  In other areas of mathematical analysis, most spaces which arise in practice turn out to be Banach spaces as well.
According to Diestel (1984, Chapter VII), the classical Banach spaces are those defined by Dunford & Schwartz (1958), which is the source for the following table.
Glossary of symbols for the table below:
