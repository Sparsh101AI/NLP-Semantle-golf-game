In geometry, the incircle or inscribed circle of a triangle is the largest circle that can be contained in the triangle; it touches (is tangent to) the three sides. The center of the incircle is a triangle center called the triangle's incenter.
An excircle or escribed circle of the triangle is a circle lying outside the triangle, tangent to one of its sides and tangent to the extensions of the other two. Every triangle has three distinct excircles, each tangent to one of the triangle's sides.
The center of the incircle, called the incenter, can be found as the intersection of the three internal angle bisectors. The center of an excircle is the intersection of the internal bisector of one angle (at vertex A, for example) and the external bisectors of the other two. The center of this excircle is called the excenter relative to the vertex A, or the excenter of A. Because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector, it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three excircle centers form an orthocentric system. but not all polygons do; those that do are tangential polygons. See also tangent lines to circles.
Suppose

{\displaystyle \triangle ABC}

 has an incircle with radius

Let

 be the touchpoints where the incircle touches 



B

{\displaystyle BC}

A

{\displaystyle AC}

, and 



A

.
The incenter is the point where the internal angle bisectors of

 and

The distance from vertex

The trilinear coordinates for a point in the triangle is the ratio of all the distances to the triangle sides. Because the incenter is the same distance from all sides of the triangle, the trilinear coordinates for the incenter are

The barycentric coordinates for a point in a triangle give weights such that the point is the weighted average of the triangle vertex positions.
Barycentric coordinates for the incenter are given by

{\displaystyle \ a:b:c}

where 



a


{\displaystyle a}

where 



A


{\displaystyle A}

B

 are the angles at the three vertices.
The Cartesian coordinates of the incenter are a weighted average of the coordinates of the three vertices using the side lengths of the triangle relative to the perimeter (that is, using the barycentric coordinates given above, normalized to sum to unity) as weights. The weights are positive so the incenter lies inside the triangle as stated above. If the three vertices are located at

The collection of triangle centers may be given the structure of a group under coordinate-wise multiplication of trilinear coordinates; in this group, the incenter forms the identity element.
The distances from a vertex to the two nearest touchpoints are equal; for example:

Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.

The incenter lies in the medial triangle (whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides).

Therefore,

An excircle or escribed circle of the triangle is a circle lying outside the triangle, tangent to one of its sides and tangent to the extensions of the other two. Every triangle has three distinct excircles, each tangent to one of the triangle's sides.
The center of an excircle is the intersection of the internal bisector of one angle (at vertex 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, for example) and the external bisectors of the other two. The center of this excircle is called the excenter relative to the vertex 



A


{\displaystyle A}

, or the excenter of 



A


{\displaystyle A}

. Because the internal bisector of an angle is perpendicular to its external bisector, it follows that the center of the incircle together with the three excircle centers form an orthocentric system.

The Nagel point is the isotomic conjugate of the Gergonne point.
In geometry, the nine-point circle is a circle that can be constructed for any given triangle. It is so named because it passes through nine significant concyclic points defined from the triangle. These nine points are:
The midpoint of each side of the triangle
The foot of each altitude
The midpoint of the line segment from each vertex of the triangle to the orthocenter (where the three altitudes meet; these line segments lie on their respective altitudes).In 1822, Karl Feuerbach discovered that any triangle's nine-point circle is externally tangent to that triangle's three excircles and internally tangent to its incircle; this result is known as Feuerbach's theorem. He proved that:
... the circle which passes through the feet of the altitudes of a triangle is tangent to all four circles which in turn are tangent to the three sides of the triangle ... (Feuerbach 1822) harv error: no target: CITEREFFeuerbach1822 (help)The triangle center at which the incircle and the nine-point circle touch is called the Feuerbach point.

d


{\displaystyle d}

 is the distance between the circumcenter and the incenter.

 is the distance between the circumcenter and that excircle's center.
Some (but not all) quadrilaterals have an incircle. These are called tangential quadrilaterals. Among their many properties perhaps the most important is that their two pairs of opposite sides have equal sums. This is called the Pitot theorem.
More generally, a polygon with any number of sides that has an inscribed circle (that is, one that is tangent to each side) is called a tangential polygon.
