In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a bounding point of a subset of a vector space is a conceptual extension of the boundary of a set.
Let 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 be a subset of a vector space 



X


{\displaystyle X}

.  Then 



x
âˆˆ
X


{\displaystyle x\in X}

 is a bounding point for 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 if it is neither an internal point for 



A


{\displaystyle A}

 nor its complement.
