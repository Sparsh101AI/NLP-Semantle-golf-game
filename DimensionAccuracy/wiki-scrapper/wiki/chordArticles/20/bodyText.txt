In geometry, the pentagonal prism  is a prism with a pentagonal base.  It is a type of heptahedron with 10 faces, 15 edges, and 10 vertices.
If faces are all regular, the pentagonal prism is a semiregular polyhedron, more generally, a uniform polyhedron, and the third in an infinite set of prisms formed by square sides and two regular polygon caps. It can be seen as a truncated pentagonal hosohedron, represented by Schl√§fli symbol t{2,5}. Alternately it can be seen as the Cartesian product of a regular pentagon and a line segment, and represented by the product {5}x{}. The dual of a pentagonal prism is a pentagonal bipyramid.
The symmetry group of a right pentagonal prism is D5h of order 20. The rotation group is D5 of order 10.
The volume, as for all prisms, is the product of the area of the pentagonal base times the height or distance along any edge perpendicular to the base. For a uniform pentagonal prism with edges h the formula is

Nonuniform pentagonal prisms called pentaprisms are also used in optics to rotate an image through a right angle without changing its chirality.
It exists as cells of four nonprismatic uniform 4-polytopes in 4 dimensions:
 The pentagonal stephanoid has pentagonal dihedral symmetry and has the same vertices as the uniform pentagonal prism.Weisstein, Eric W. "Pentagonal prism". MathWorld.
