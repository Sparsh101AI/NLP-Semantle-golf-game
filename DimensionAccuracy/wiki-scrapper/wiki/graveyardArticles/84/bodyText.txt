Stamford, Connecticut is increasingly being used as a filming location for motion pictures, especially since a 30 percent state tax credit for movie production took effect on July 1, 2006. The tax credit immediately started attracting filmmakers to Connecticut, creating a nascent industry connected to feature film production.
Two of the more significant movies shot in Stamford before the tax credit were The Cardinal, directed by Otto Preminger and Boomerang, directed by Elia Kazan.
