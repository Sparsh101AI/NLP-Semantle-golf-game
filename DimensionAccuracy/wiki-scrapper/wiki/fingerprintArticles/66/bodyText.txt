He accounted for 11 touchdowns as a freshman – two passing, two receiving, and seven rushing.

He scored 15 touchdowns – four receiving, one returning, and ten rushing during the 2009 season.
In his junior season, Cobb had a new head coach in Joker Phillips, who said "He's one of the best leaders I've ever been around." He scored a touchdown on a punt return against Western Kentucky.On October 9, 2010, Cobb scored four touchdowns against undefeated Auburn, tying the Kentucky school record for career touchdowns at 32.

The return was later named Play of the Year at the season-ending NFL Honors banquet.
In a Monday Night Football game against the Minnesota Vikings on November 14, Cobb scored his second special teams touchdown of the year on an 80-yard punt return in the first quarter.

On March 7, 2015, the Green Bay Packers signed Cobb to a four-year, $40 million contract with a signing bonus of $13 million. After signing the deal, Cobb explained his thought process.  "At the end of the day, my heart was in Green Bay, and I knew that's where I wanted to be. I knew I had a good thing going for me, and still I signed a pretty lucrative deal that I can handle as far as making that last for the rest of my life." Cobb also mentioned that the NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks still bothered him. "Obviously, that loss still hurts. It still feels fresh. I want to win a championship, and we were right there. We were close. We didn't do what we needed to do to win, but we have a lot of the guys coming back this year, same guys. A lot of our core guys, and we believe that puts us in the mix. So we have to handle business this offseason as far as continuing to get better on a daily basis. Obviously, next season, we have to put ourselves in position to go on a run."
In 2015, Cobb had one of his best seasons as teammate Jordy Nelson went down with an ACL in the preseason, posting only six touchdowns. On December 3, during the "Miracle in Motown" win, Cobb recovered a James Starks fumble to give the Packers their first touchdown of the game to make the score 20–7 in favor of the Detroit Lions.
