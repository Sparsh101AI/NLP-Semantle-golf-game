The phylum Elusimicrobiota, previously known as "Termite Group 1", has been shown to be widespread in different ecosystems like marine environment, sewage sludge, contaminated sites and soils, and toxic wastes. The high abundance of Elusimicrobiota representatives is only evidenced for the lineage of symbionts found in termites and ants.
The first organism to be cultured was Elusimicrobium minutum; however, other two species have been partially described and placed in a separate class, known as Microbiaendophisolisum.
The currently accepted taxonomy is based solemnly on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN)  and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
