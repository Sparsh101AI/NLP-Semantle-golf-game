Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (ATP-forming) (EC 3.6.1.61, Ndx1) is an enzyme with systematic name P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (ATP-forming). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
(1) P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate + H2O 



⇌


{\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }

 2 ATP
(2) P1,P5-bis(5'-adenosyl)pentaphosphate + H2O 



⇌


{\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }

 ATP + ADP
(3) P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)tetraphosphate + H2O 



⇌


{\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }

 ATP + AMPThe enzyme requires the presence of the divalent cations (Mn, Mg, Zn, and Co).
