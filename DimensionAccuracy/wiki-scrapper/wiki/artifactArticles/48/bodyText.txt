Your Home Library, founded in 1917, serves the village of Johnson City and the surrounding area.
The library building was originally the old Brigham homestead, erected by Elijah Brigham in 1850. The old farmhouse was of wooden construction but was later replaced by a much finer homestead. The new homestead was erected in 1885, and its foundations, walls, and partitions were constructed using brick from the Brigham Brick Yard, situated just north of the library building. The building was chosen by Harry L. Johnson and the Endicott Johnson Corporation as the site of the present library.
In 1920, a large addition was built and the children's room, dining rooms, and kitchen were removed to the new wing of the building. The library was owned, and entirely supported, by the Endicott Johnson Corporation until September 1921 when it was incorporated.
In 1938, the library building was purchased by the Village of Johnson City. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
