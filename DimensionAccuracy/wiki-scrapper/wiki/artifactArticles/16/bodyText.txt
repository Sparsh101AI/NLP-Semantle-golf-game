Danube is a town in Herkimer County, New York, United States. The population was 1,039 at the 2010 census. Early Palatine German immigrants in the eighteenth century named the town after the Danube River in Europe.
The town is in southeastern Herkimer County, southeast of the city of Little Falls and south of the Mohawk River.
The town was first settled by Europeans around 1730 on the territories of Lindsey's (1730) and Van Horne's (1731) patents. The town was within the territory of the Mohawk people.
In coordination with the colonial government the Mohawk had allowed a fortified settlement east of here. They had agreed in 1712 to allow some settlement by Palatine Germans in exchange for Queen Anne helping with their defense against the French and Indian allies. Fort Schuyler was constructed south of the Mohawk River near one of their major settlements at the time.
The town of Danube was formed in 1817 from the town of Minden (in Montgomery County). Part of Danube was taken off in 1828 to form the town of Stark.
The Herkimer Home and Mohawk Upper Castle Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
