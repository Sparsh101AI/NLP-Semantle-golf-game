Lampland is an impact crater on Mars, located in the Thaumasia quadrangle at 35.9°S latitude and 79.6°W longitude. It is 79.0 kilometers in diameter and was named after Carl Otto Lampland. The name was approved by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in 1973.
The density of impact craters is used to determine the surface ages of Mars and other solar system bodies. The older the surface, the more craters present. Crater shapes can reveal the presence of ground ice. Lampland Crater sits in an area with many craters, hence this region is considered to be quite old.
