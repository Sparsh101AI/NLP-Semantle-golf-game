The Commander Littoral Strike Group (COMLSG) is a senior British Royal Navy Amphibious warfare appointment. COMLSG, who is based in Stonehouse Barracks, Stonehouse, Plymouth, reports to Commander United Kingdom Strike Force. It was first established in 1971 as Commodore Amphibious Warfare. 
Today COMLSG is a deployable one-star Maritime Component Commander held at Very High Readiness (72 hours or less) in order to respond to unexpected global events. In most circumstances, COMLSG and his staff would deploy in the Fleet Flagship (such as HMS Albion, or one of the new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers) in order to command a deployed task group.  While structured and trained to conduct high intensity war-fighting (with an emphasis on amphibious operations, working alongside 3 Commando Brigade, the staff are capable of commanding a diverse range of activities such as evacuation operations, or disaster relief.
In the 1960s most of the Navy's amphibious capability was under Commodore, Amphibious Forces, Far East Fleet (COMAFFEF), based at Singapore Naval Base. In March 1971, following the withdrawal from Singapore, and the return of 3 Commando Brigade to the UK, COMAFFEF was retitled Commodore Amphibious Warfare (COMAW), and moved to Fort Southwick, just outside Portsmouth. COMAW became subordinate to Flag Officer, Carriers and Amphibious Ships (FOCAF).
After 1979 when FOCAF became Flag Officer, Third Flotilla, COMAW became part of Third Flotilla. In 1981, Commodore Michael Clapp moved COMAW to Stonehouse Barracks in order to be based alongside HQ 3 Commando Brigade again. Following the pivotal role of the Royal Navy's amphibious forces during the Falklands War, when Clapp directed the Amphibious Group of the British task force, alongside Brigadier Julian Thompson, this co-location of the two Headquarters has endured ever since.
From 1992 COMAW reported to the two-star deployable battlestaff commander, currently titled Commander UK Strike Force. The reestablishment of the Amphibious Warfare Warfare Squadron was announced in March 1997. But the commander's title was renamed from COMAW to Commander Amphibious Task Group (COMATG) on 1 December 1997; subsequent references to a 'squadron' are hard to find. 
In the early 21st century COMATG deployments included Operation Veritas in 2001; Operation Telic, the 2003 invasion of Iraq; Operation Vela in 2006; Operation Highbrow, evacuating personnel from Lebanon in 2006; leading Combined Task Force 152 in the Middle East in 2008; and Operation Taurus in 2009.
Until 2011, COMATG was one of the deployable maritime commanders who with their headquarters reported to the Fleet Battle Staff, alongside two others, the Commander United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group (COMCSG) and the Commander UK Task Group (COMUKTG).  However, following the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010, COMCSG and COMUKTG were abolished as separate commands and COMATG became the sole deployable HQ, under the new title of COMUKTG, responsible for command of the Response Force Task Group.  At this point, the former Commander UK Task Group became Deputy Commander United Kingdom Maritime Forces.
In early October 2012, the Commander UK Task Group, Commodore Paddy McAlpine led the Cougar 12 deployment of six ships and more than 3,000 marines and sailors to the Mediterranean Sea. One of the principle purposes of the deployment was to conduct large-scale amphibious exercises with allies. Key exercises included: 'Corsican Lion' with France; 'Albanian Lion' with Albania; a visit to Malta and exercises with the United States Navy and the Algerian Armed Forces.
McAlpine said: "Cougar 12 provides us with a superb opportunity to rekindle our amphibious capability after a prolonged period when our focus has been ..elsewhere." Exercise 'Corsican Lion' was the main focus of Cougar 12 and was designed to develop the maritime and amphibious components of the Anglo-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force. The group worked alongside the French Navy's Task Force 473 led by French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.
Brigadier Martin Smith of 3 Commando Brigade was quoted saying: "It is an incredibly versatile force and our burgeoning interoperability with the French further proves this. The quality of Royal Marines Commandos and French Marines delivers a highly effective first response capability ..optimised for early entry operations."
In March 2015, the post of COMUKTG reverted to its previous title of COMATG. COMATG was responsible to Commander United Kingdom Maritime Forces.
COMATG was re-titled Commander Littoral Strike Group on 1 October 2019, to reflect the expected increased size and capabilities of the group, including Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.
