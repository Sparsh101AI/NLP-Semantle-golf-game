In addition, in 2007, for the release of the Spider-Man 2.1 DVD, Cork and Bruce Scivally wrote and compiled the Spidey Sense 2.1-trivia track, a closed captioning feature on Disc 1 of the DVD, which includes integrated pop-ups that provides information about the Spider-Man actors, directors, production, comic books and Spider-Man legacy.

John Cork was born in Montgomery, Ala. He currently splits his time between Florida and California. He was married to singer Nicole Dillenberg from 1994 until 2014. They have one son, Jimmy Cork.

Cork has said that he and his ex-wife honeymooned at Goldeneye, the secluded home in Jamaica where Ian Fleming wrote his 14 James Bond books. Goldeneye's owner, Island Records founder and hotelier Chris Blackwell, who served as location manager for Dr. No (1962), waived the rental for the three-bedroom villa as a wedding present, according to Cork.
