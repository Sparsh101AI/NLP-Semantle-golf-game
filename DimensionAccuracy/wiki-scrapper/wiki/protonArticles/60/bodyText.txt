The Malaysian Space Agency (Malay: Agensi Angkasa Malaysia), abbreviated MYSA, is the national space agency of Malaysia. On 20 February 2019, the Malaysian Cabinet had approved the establishment of MYSA through the merging of Malaysian Remote Sensing Agency (MRSA) and National Space Agency (ANGKASA).
In March 2019, the Minister of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change, Yeo Bee Yin said MYSA would focus on technology, infrastructure and strategic space application development. It would be tasked with gathering comprehensive satellite data and information systems to assist various public agencies effectively in terms of environment, natural resources, food security, disaster management and climate change management. The collected data and information can be shared with the private sector, to help them develop and achieve their own modelling system. The merge of MRSA and ANGKASA into one agency would improve work efficiencies by optimising the use of existing resources and facilities.
As of 2020, the director general is Tuan Haji Azlikamil Napiah.
