The Place Castellane is a historic square in the 6th arrondissement of Marseille, Bouches-du-Rhône, France. It was built in 1774.
The square was named for Henri-César de Castellane-Majastre, an aristocrat who donated the land for its construction in 1774. A fountain with an obelisk used as a lavoir was built in the middle of the square in 1798.
In 1911, the obelisk was relocated to Mazargues. Meanwhile, Jules Cantini donated a new fountain, which was designed by sculptor André-Joseph Allar. The fountain, completed in 1913, represents three Provençal rivers: the Durance, the Gardon, and the Rhône.
The square, with the original obelisk,  is mentioned by Joseph Conrad in his 1919 novel entitled The Arrow of Gold.
