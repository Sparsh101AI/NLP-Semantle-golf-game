It also simulcasts the programming on 99.5 FM. 1510 AM is under ownership of Townsquare Media. 99.5 FM is owned by Eastern New Mexico University under a LMA to Townsquare Media.

1510 AM is a United States clear-channel frequency; KMND must leave the air during the period from sunset to sunrise in order the protect the nighttime skywave signal of WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee.
1510 AM signed on in Midland in 1958. It began as a 500 watt daytimer called KABH. Over its early years it was a middle of road station. Partners in cross town KNFM acquired an interest in KABH and the letters were changed to KNAM. About 1979 the station changed owners, relocated its office, and changed calls to KMND for "Command".
As an affiliate of the Dallas Cowboys, KMND carried the Wade Phillips show and the Dallas Cowboys daily report, but they did not have the contract to air the games. Sister station KGEE/KNFM aired the Cowboys games in the Odessa-Midland area. As an affiliate of ESPN Radio, the station carried commercials for the ESPN Radio College Football Game of the Week, the BCS on ESPN Radio, the NIT on ESPN Radio, and Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio, but the station only aired college bowl games that were sold as part of ESPN Radio coverage nationwide. In 2009 they ended up adding the full broadcast schedule beginning with the NBA on ESPN Radio and then continuing into Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio. They also carried live coverage of the  Midland High Bulldogs and the  Midland Lee Rebels post-season play for all sports except football. The station doesn't produce any local shows, but in the past they produced Sportstalk with Robbie Burns which aired weekdays from 3 PM- 6 PM and Saturday from 10 AM- 12 PM. They also aired coverage of post-season sports for the Midland College Chaparalls from 2004–2008. In 2009 those rights moved to KQRX.
Before becoming an ESPN Radio affiliate, KMND specialized in talk radio shows now found on KCRS (AM), including Rush Limbaugh, and tejano music.
In March 2017 KMND moved from ESPN Radio to Fox Sports Radio.
