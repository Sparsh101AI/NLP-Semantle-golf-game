Discovery History  is a British channel with programming about history from Warner Bros. Discovery.
The channel was initially known as the Discovery Civilisation Channel, later dropping 'Channel' from the name, and was devoted to documentaries regarding history and civilizations, historic, ancient or present, launched on Sky Digital on 1 October 1998. On 1 November 2007, Discovery Civilisation was re-branded as Discovery Knowledge, by Heavenly. The new channel was still focused on history and natural history, but the schedule now included programming on engineering, crime and technology.
After just over three years, on 7 November 2010, Discovery Knowledge was rebranded as Discovery History. The idea behind this rebranding was to take the channel's focus back to becoming "the only UK channel dedicated to factual history", to counter the fact that its competitors History and Yesterday had begun showing more reality and scripted programming, respectively.
In February 2013, A+E Networks, who operate History, lost a High Court battle to stop Discovery from using the Discovery History brand in the UK.
