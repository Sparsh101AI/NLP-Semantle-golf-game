96.7 started out as the easy listening station for Southwest Montana. In between 1983 and 1984, it became a Top 40 format.  However it could not keep up with KUUB.  By 1985, it became an Adult Contemporary format station. By 1990, it took the moniker 96 the sky, Montana's soft rock.  Throughout the next ten years, The Sky would move towards a CHR format.  It first moved towards hot AC in 1998.  Through the next years, the sky moved towards adult top 40 with a CHR format consisting of Destiny's Child, Britney Spears and Creed, N'Sync, and The Backstreet Boys.  By 2002 it became a full-blown top 40 under the All-hit 96 The sky moniker.  In 2004 The callsign changed to KISN, the callsign used to be that of an Adult top 40 radio station in Salt Lake City.  That frequency is now KZHT also a top 40 station owned by the same company until IHeartMedia (Clear Channel Radio) spun off its radio stations in small-town markets with Bozeman being one of them.  For much of the 2000s, Kiss FM was known for mixing in hard rock since Bozeman did not have an active rock outlet.  They also have thrown in local artists especially those in the hip hop genre.
