Colorado's 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Colorado based primarily in the City and County of Denver in the central part of the state. The district includes all of the City and County of Denver, and the nearby suburbs of Glendale, Englewood, Sheridan, and Cherry Hills Village in Arapahoe County. Its southern tip encompasses a small part of Jefferson County, including the communities of Columbine and Ken Caryl.
The district has been represented by Democrat Diana DeGette since 1997. An urban and diverse district based in the heart of Metropolitan Denver, with a Cook Partisan Voting Index rating of D+24, it is the most Democratic district in all of the Mountain West, and one of the two most Democratic districts in the American West not located on the Pacific coast (with Arizona's 7th, covering central Phoenix, having the same PVI.)  Only two Republicans have been elected to the seat since the Great Depression: Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt from 1971 to 1973, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats. No Republican has even notched 30% of the vote in the district after 1998.
Following the 1990 United States Census and consequential redrawing of Colorado's congressional districts, the 1st congressional district consisted of all of the City and County of Denver and parts of Adams, Arapahoe, and Jefferson counties.
Following the 2000 United States Census and consequential redistricting of Colorado's congressional districts, the 1st congressional district consisted of all of the City and County of Denver and parts of Arapahoe County, including parts or all of the cities of Englewood, Cherry Hills Village, Sheridan, Aurora, and Glendale.
Following the 2010 United States Census and consequential redistricting of Colorado's congressional districts, the 1st congressional district consisted of all of the City and County of Denver and parts of Arapahoe County including parts or all of the cities of Englewood, Cherry Hills Village, Sheridan, Aurora, and Glendale. The 1st district also took in additional area in the southwestern suburbs which included parts of Jefferson County and the CDPs of Columbine and Ken Caryl.
