The 1922 United States House of Representatives elections were held for the United States House of Representatives in November 1922, in the middle of President Warren G. Harding's term. Just as voters had expressed their distrust of Wilson in 1920, now voters had a chance to express the widespread feeling that Congress had failed to address economic problems, especially the brief but sharp economic recession of 1921–1922. Most of the seats that Republicans lost had long been held by Democrats, who now returned with an even stronger base in the major cities.
The Republican Party lost a net of 77 seats to the opposition Democratic Party. The Republicans were neither unified nor well led, and they could boast of very few successes except tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations, and higher tariffs that pleased manufacturing interest but raised consumer prices.   With Senator Bob La Follette as their unofficial leader, some progressives formed a small but highly vocal group on the left of the Republican Party. Former  Progressives from 1912 who had supported Theodore Roosevelt mostly refused to support LaFollette, who had been a bitter enemy of Roosevelt. Republicans nonetheless retained a narrow majority, although splits in the party made it difficult for Harding to govern. In Minnesota, the Farmer–Labor Party, also gained several seats. The Democrats showed their greatest support in the industrial cities, where the Irish and German element returned to that party. In addition, there was growing support among the more recent immigrants, who had become more Americanized. Many ethnic families now had a veteran in their midst, and paid closer attention to national issues, such as the question of a bonus for veterans. There was also an expression of annoyance with the federal prohibition of beer and wine, and the closing of most saloons.

Pennsylvania was one of the only states to conduct redistricting between 1920 and 1922, when no nationwide reapportionment occurred. Incumbents have been shown in the most closely corresponding new districts. The four districts shown as new below replaced the four at-large seats used previously; since the at-large seats were all Republican held, the new districts are only nominally Republican gains.
