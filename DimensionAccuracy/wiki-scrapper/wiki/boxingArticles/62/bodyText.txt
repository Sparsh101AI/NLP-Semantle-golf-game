South Central China or South-Central China (Chinese: 中南; pinyin: Zhōngnán; lit. 'Central-South') is a region of the People's Republic of China defined by State Council that includes the provinces of Guangdong, Hainan, Henan, Hubei and Hunan, as well as the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; however, the two provincial-level special administrative regions (SAR) are also often included under South Central China: Hong Kong and Macau.
South Central China is often divided into South China (华南) and Central China (华中) regions due to difference between civilian customs.
