The Pan Asian Boxing Association also known as PABA is an organisation for professional boxing in the Central Asia, Oceania, Pan Pacific, Eurasia and Southeast and Far East nations. It was formed in 1995 and is headquartered in Seoul.
Since its inception in 1995 there have been over 800 sanctioned championship matches. Twenty two PABA champions have eventually been crowned as WBA world champions in their respective division, whilst PABA has assisted 37 PABA champions' challenge to the WBA world title. In March 2016, WBA voted at their annual convention to have WBA Oceania title to be the exclusive regional title for the Asia Pacific. Due to this, WBA discontinued their relationship with PABA. PABA created their own sanctioning body called the World Boxing Society. In 2018, PABA and their new sanctioning body WBS disbanded.
