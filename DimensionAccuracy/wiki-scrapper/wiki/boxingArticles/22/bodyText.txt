The cultural icons and symbols of the United Kingdom are mostly interchangeable with symbols of Britain. This page could, theoretically, be called British cultural icons. The list includes certain symbols of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland which, for one reason or another, may be perceived to be shared by other parts of the United Kingdom, or were founded or invented after the Union of the Crowns  in 1603 or the British Act of Union 1707, or before the creation of the constituent countries (hence the inclusion of Stonehenge). It is based upon the idea that there is a sense of Britishness and shared cultural icons.
