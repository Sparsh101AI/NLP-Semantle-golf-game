Malaysian State Roads System (Malay: Sistem Laluan Negeri Malaysia) are the secondary roads in Malaysia with a total length of 247,027.61 km (as of December 2021). The construction and maintenance works of state roads in Malaysia is managed by Malaysian Public Works Department (JKR) of each state and funded by state governments. The standard of the state roads is similar with the federal roads except for the coding system, where the codes for state roads begin with state codes followed by route number, for example Johor State Route J32 is labeled as J32. If a state road crosses the state border, the state code will change, for example route B20 in Salak Tinggi, Selangor will change to N20 after crossing the border of Negeri Sembilan to Nilai.
The codes assigned to each state is the same as those of the car number plates except for Sabah.
