The 1979–80 season was the 20th season of the European Cup Winners' Cup, a football tournament organised by UEFA for the cup winners from each of its member associations. The competition was won by Spanish club Valencia, who beat Arsenal of England on penalties after a goalless final at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. It was the only Cup Winners' Cup to be decided on penalties (although two previous finals had required replays). It was Valencia's third European title, adding to the two Inter-Cities Fairs Cup titles they won in the 1960s.
