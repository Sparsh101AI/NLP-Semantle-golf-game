The Prva nogometna liga (English: First football league) or, more commonly, Prva NL or 1. NL is the second tier of the football league system in Croatia. The league was formed in 1991 with the breakup of Yugoslavia and the dissolution of the Yugoslav Second League. The 1. NL is operated by the Croatian Football Federation, which also was formed in 1991, contributing (along with the newly formed Football Association of Slovenia) to the dissolution  of the Football Association of Yugoslavia.
Between the 2001–02 season and 2005–06 season, the league was split in two divisions, one being the Northern Croatian Second League and the other being the Southern Croatian Second League. Each of these two leagues comprised twelve teams playing under a system pretty much identical to the one in the HNL. However, since the start of the 2006–07 season, the First Football League comprises twelve teams from the entire country. Relegation from this division is into the 2. NL.
It was previously known as the Second Football League, but was renamed with the other leagues for the start of the 2022–2023 season.
