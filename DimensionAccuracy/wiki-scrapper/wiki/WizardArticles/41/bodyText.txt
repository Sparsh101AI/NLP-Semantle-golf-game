Marcel Lotka (born 25 May 2001) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Borussia Dortmund. Born in Germany, he represents Poland as a youth international.
In March 2022, Lotka signed a two-year contract with Borussia Dortmund II, starting in the 2022â€“23 season, but after several games in the starting line-up of Hertha BSC with positive acclaim, the Berlin-based club started exploring options to reverse the deal and keep the player for the next season. However, this appeal was unsuccessful; in May 2022, Lotka's move to Dortmund was officially confirmed.
