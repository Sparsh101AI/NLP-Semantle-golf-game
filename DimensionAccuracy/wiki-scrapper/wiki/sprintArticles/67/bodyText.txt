Formula Masters China, FMCS (Chinese: 青年冠军方程式系列赛) (previously known as Formula Pilota China), was a single-seater racing series based in Asia. The series was created in 2011 after the success of the Formula Abarth championship that was created a year before.
Each event in the championship is normally run to a three-day schedule. It comprises two free practice sessions on the first day, one qualifying session and 45–55 km or 25-minute race on the second day, and a 45–55 km or 25-minute race on the third day. The grid for the second race is determined by the fastest lap in the first race; if drivers set equal times, priority will be given to driver who set the time first.
Events have been held predominantly on Chinese circuits at Guangdong, Ordos International Circuit, Shanghai, and Shanghai Tianma, as well as Sepang and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.
All the teams in Formula Pilota China use the same Tatuus FA010 chassis and a 1.4 litre	FPT engine.
