Playing Major League Baseball in four decades has been attained by only 31 players in the league's history, dating from the 1870s to the present day.
Outside of skill and durability, a player must also have some "generational luck" to have started his career in the later years of a decade, so that if he is still playing 21–24 years later, he is playing in the early years of a fourth decade. For example, Pete Rose started his career in 1963, so he would have had to play 28 seasons to make the list. Whereas Bill Buckner, whose career started in the last year of the 1960s, finished his career in the first year of the 1990s, requiring only 22 seasons to make the list.  Most of the players on the list started their careers in the final or second-to-last year of their first decade and finished their careers in the first or second year of their fourth decade (a notable exception is Nolan Ryan, whose 27 seasons played is a major league record).
Nick Altrock, Minnie Miñoso and Satchel Paige are the only three players to have appeared in major league baseball games in five different decades. None were full-time players at the end of their careers; Altrock was a coach on the Washington Senators and appeared sparingly over just seventeen games in a twenty-two season span from 1912-1933. Miñoso was also a coach for his former team, the White Sox, and made cameo appearances in two seasons (having not played in the majors in over a decade) at the ages of 50 and 54 as part of a publicity stunt organized by owners Bill and Mike Veeck. Satchel Paige played in professional baseball for over 40 years not all of them in the major leagues but his first major league season was 1926 and his last was 1965. 
Since 1900 (the first year that a player could play in a "fourth decade"), every decade except the 1940s and 2020s has added at least one player to the list. Every player who debuted in the 1990s had announced his retirement by 2019, with the exception of Bartolo Colón, who was a regular starter in the Mexican League in 2021 and last appeared in an MLB game in 2018.
Major League Baseball recognizes the first major league season as 1876, the inaugural season of the National League. The following three players played parts of their careers in the 1850s and 1860s, and do not qualify as four decade players, although they played four decades at the highest level of play available to them at the time: Joe Start (1859-1886), Candy Nelson (1867-1890), and Deacon White (1868-1890).
African Americans have played professionally since 1878 when Bud Fowler first played professionally, although he had been playing since at least 1877 and possibly as early as 1872. Major League Baseball does not consider any players or leagues prior to 1920 to be Major league players. The following players played four decades at the highest level of play possible to them at the time: Bud Fowler (1878-1904), Clarence Williams (1886-1913), Candy Jim Taylor (1904-1942), Smokey Joe Williams (1905-1932), John Henry Lloyd (1906-1932), Pelayo Chacón (1908-1931), Oscar Charleston (1915-1941), José Fernández (1915-1947), George Britt (1917-1942), and Bill Holland (1919-1941). Taylor also played at the highest level possible to him for five decades.
The players are listed by primary position played and years spanning their careers. Fifteen players from the group have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Of the 31 players, 12 were primarily pitchers, 6 were primarily catchers, 7 were primarily outfielders, and 6 were primarily infielders; the group covers virtually the complete range of baseball positions, missing only a third baseman.
