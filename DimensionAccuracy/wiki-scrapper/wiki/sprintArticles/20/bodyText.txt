Wheelchair rugby league is a wheelchair-based version of rugby league football. It was developed by French rugby league player, coach and official, Wally Salvan in 2004. Unlike other wheelchair sports, people without disabilities are allowed to compete in top-level competition.
The game shares many features with the regular rugby league:
Use of a size 4 rugby ball
Ball may only be passed backwards
Each team retains possession for six tackles, after which there is a hand-over
A modified version of the play-the-ball is used after a tackle
Same offside rules as rugby league

A tackle is counted when we take a tag off a shoulder
All kicks, penalties, drop outs, conversions, are all done with the fist
It is generally played on a handball court, dimensions being 40x20
There are indoor rugby posts put in place for conversions, drop kicks, and penalty kicksThe inaugural Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup was held at indoor venues in Sydney, Australia in 2008. The 2013 Wheelchair RL World Cup was held in Gillingham, England in July. The 2017 World Cup was held in the south of France in July.
