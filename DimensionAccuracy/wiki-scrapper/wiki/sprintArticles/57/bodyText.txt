Note: Two teams in the same division could not meet in the division series.
For much of the season, 2010 was frequently labeled the Year of the Pitcher (though this title is also taken by the 1968 season). 2010 saw many significant pitching achievements, including:
Six no-hitters were thrown. They were thrown by Ubaldo Jiménez (April 17), Dallas Braden (May 9), Roy Halladay (May 29), Edwin Jackson (June 25), Matt Garza (July 26), and Halladay again, this time in Game 1 of the NLDS. It was only the third time in major league history that at least six no-hitters were thrown in a single season. Braden's no-hitter and Halladay's first were both perfect games.
Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game (June 2), in which Galarraga set down the first twenty-six Cleveland Indians batters in order before umpire Jim Joyce incorrectly ruled Jason Donald safe at first on a ground ball.  If not for Joyce's mistaken call, Galarraga's would have been the third perfect game in a season (an MLB record, but it was later done in 2012 by Philip Humber, Matt Cain, and Félix Hernández), and the third in less than a month.
MLB pitchers combined for 329 shutouts (the most since 1972, when there were 357) and a record 34,306 strikeouts (an average of 1,144 per team).
A record-tying 15 pitchers recorded 200 or more strikeouts.
Neftalí Feliz of the Texas Rangers earned 40 saves, breaking the record for most saves in a season for a rookie (previously held by Kazuhiro Sasaki).
Stephen Strasburg of the Washington Nationals struck out 41 batters in his first four major league starts, a major league record.* Served as interim manager, replacing Cecil Cooper.
The following managers who were interim managers for 2009 will lead their respective teams in 2010:

Threw the 19th perfect game in Major League history, defeating the Tampa Bay Rays 4–0 on May 9, Mother's Day in the USA.  Symbolically and coincidentally (as he had lost his mom to breast cancer while in high school), players wore pink wristbands and ribbons on this day to raise breast cancer awareness.  It was also the second perfect game in Oakland A's history; the first coming on May 8, 1968, when Jim "Catfish" Hunter beat the Minnesota Twins, 4–0.
Roy Halladay (PHI):
Exactly 20 days later, on May 29, Halladay threw the 20th perfect game in Major League history, defeating the Florida Marlins 1–0. This achievement marked the first time in the modern (post-1900) era that two perfect games were pitched in the same season.  In 1880, both Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward both hurled a perfect game five days apart. It was also the first perfect game for the Phillies since Jim Bunning's Father's Day perfect game on June 21, 1964, beating the New York Mets, 6–0.
Armando Galarraga (DET):
Galarraga threw what would have been a third perfect game on June 2 against the Cleveland Indians. However, first base umpire Jim Joyce made an errant call on Galarraga's coverage of first base on a flip throw by first baseman Miguel Cabrera, which would have been the final out. "I just cost [Galarraga] a perfect game", Joyce replied. "I thought he beat the throw. I was convinced he beat the throw, until I saw the replay. It was the biggest call of my career. I don't blame them a bit or anything that was said. I would've said it myself if I had been Galarraga. I would've been the first person in my face, and he never said a word to me." The 17,738 fans—as well as players and manager Jim Leyland—argued following the game.Ubaldo Jiménez (COL):
Threw the first no-hitter in the Rockies 18-year history by blanking the Atlanta Braves 4–0 on April 17.  It was also his first career no-hitter and the first no-hitter of the season.
Edwin Jackson (CHW)/(ARI):
Threw a no-hitter as a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks against the Tampa Bay Rays in a 1–0 win on June 25.  It was the second no-hitter in Diamondbacks history and his first in his career. The only other pitcher to have a no-hit game was Randy Johnson against Atlanta, and that was a perfect game in 2004.
Jackson was traded to the Chicago White Sox on July 30.
Matt Garza (TB):
Threw the franchise's first no-hitter facing the minimum 27 batters (surrendering a walk in the 2nd inning) beating the Detroit Tigers 5–0 on July 26.Roy Halladay (PHI):
Halladay twirled the first postseason no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the fifth game of the 1956 World Series leading the Phillies to a 4–0 win in the first game of the 2010 National League Division Series at Citizens Bank Park over the Cincinnati Reds.  Halladay walked Jay Bruce in the fifth inning as the only blemish on the record.  Halladay threw 104 pitches, 74 of them for strikes, striking out eight in becoming the first pitcher to have two no-hit games in the same calendar year with one of them occurring in the postseason.Roy Halladay (PHI):
Recorded his 150th career victory with a 2–1 complete-game victory over the Houston Astros on April 11.  Halladay became the 240th player to reach this mark, and also recorded his 50th career complete game.
Bobby Jenks (CHW):
Recorded his 150th career save closing out a win against the Seattle Mariners on April 25.  Jenks became the 69th player to reach this mark.
Roy Oswalt (PHI)/(HOU):
Recorded his 1500th career strikeout as a member of the Houston Astros against the Cincinnati Reds on April 29.  Bronson Arroyo was the victim as he struck out in the 4th inning.  Oswalt became the 171st player to reach this mark.
Oswalt was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on July 29.
Recorded his 150th career victory with a 9–1 victory against the Washington Nationals on September 17.  He became the 245th player to reach this mark.
Tim Hudson (ATL):

Recorded his 1500th career strikeout against the Baltimore Orioles on May 4.  Luke Scott was the victim as he struck out in the 4th inning.  Burnett became the 172nd player to reach this mark.
Jamie Moyer (PHI):
Became the oldest pitcher to pitch a complete-game shutout in Major League history when at the age of 47 years, 170 days, he beat the Atlanta Braves, 7–0 on May 7 at Citizens Bank Park.  Phil Niekro at age 46 years, 188 days was the oldest pitcher to do that beforehand, while Satchel Paige at age 46 years, 75 days, was the oldest non-knuckleball throwing pitcher to accomplish the feat for the St. Louis Browns in 1952. Moyer also became the first pitcher to pitch complete-game shutouts in four decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s).
On June 22, allowed his record-tying 505th home run in the 2nd inning to Russell Branyan of the Cleveland Indians.  Moyer ties the record that was held by Robin Roberts.
