The Royal Institution of Cornwall (RIC) is a Learned society in Truro, Cornwall, United Kingdom.
It was founded in Truro on 5 February 1818 as the Cornwall Literary and Philosophical Institution.  The Institution was one of the earliest of seven similar societies established in England and Wales. The RIC moved to its present site in River Street in 1919 to the building that was originally Truro Savings Bank. It took its current name (Royal Institution of Cornwall) in 1821 after receiving royal patronage. It is a registered charity under English law.
The Royal Institution of Cornwall owns and manages the Royal Cornwall Museum, which has a permanent display on the history of Cornwall from prehistoric times to the present day, as well as the natural history of Cornwall, a collection of minerals and a pre-eminent collection of ceramics and fine art.
