Cydathenaeum or Kydathenaion (Greek: Κυδαθήναιον) was one of the demes in ancient Athens. It belonged in the phyle (tribe) Pandionis.
When Cleisthenes formally established the deme system in 508/7 BC, Kydathenaion was the third largest deme after Acharnae and Aphidna. Its population is estimated to have been around 3300–3600 people.
Kydathenaion was one of the five demes located within the walls of the city of Athens (alongside Koile, Kollytos, Melite, and Skambonidai).
Kydathenaion was in the very heart of Athens: it contained Acropolis, and possibly Areopagus.
Notable people from the deme include:
Cleon (died 422 BC), statesman and a general during the Peloponnesian War
Andocides (440–390 BC), one of the ten Attic orators
Aristophanes (c. 446 – c. 386 BC), comic playwright
Nicochares (died c. 345 BC), comic poet
Echedemos (fl. 190 BC), statesman, ambassador
