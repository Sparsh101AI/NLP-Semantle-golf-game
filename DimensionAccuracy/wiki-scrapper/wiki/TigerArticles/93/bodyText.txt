Especifismo (Portuguese: [eʃpesiˈfiʒmu], "specifism") is one of the two main forms of Anarchist activism championed by FARJ (Federação Anarquista do Rio de Janeiro) and other South American Anarchist organizations, the other being social insertion. Especifismo emerged as a result of Anarchist experiences in South America over the latter half of the 20th century starting with the Federación Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU), which was founded in 1956 by Anarchists who saw the need for an organization which was specifically Anarchist.
Especifismo has been summarized as:
The need for a specifically Anarchist organization built around a unity of ideas and praxis.
The use of the specifically Anarchist organization to theorize and develop strategic political and organizing work.
Active involvement in and building of autonomous and popular social movements via social insertion.Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)
