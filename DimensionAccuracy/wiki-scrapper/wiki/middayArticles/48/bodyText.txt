The fonts in the following list were included as "extras" with AppleWorks 6, which was bundled with new iMacs until 2006.
A number of fonts have also been provided with iMovie, iLife, iDVD and other Apple applications in hidden folders, for the sole use of these applications. The reason why these fonts are hidden is unknown, with licensing issues suggested as the cause. However, one may easily install them for use by all applications by copying them out of their Library directories and installing them as with any third-party font, although one should always check that the license for the fonts allows them to be used outside the given software.
Notable hidden fonts on macOS include Bank Gothic, Bodoni, Century Gothic, Century Schoolbook, Garamond, several cuts of Lucida and Monotype Twentieth Century.
