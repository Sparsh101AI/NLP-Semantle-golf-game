ISO 843 is a system for the transliteration and/or transcription of Greek characters into Latin characters.
It was released by the International Organization for Standardization in 1997. The transcription table is based on the first edition (1982) of the ELOT 743 transcription and transliteration system created by ELOT and officially adopted by the Greek government. The transliteration table provided major changes to the original one by ELOT, which in turn aligned to ISO 843 for the second edition of its ELOT 743 (2001).
Exceptions:
double vowels αυ are transliterated as au. The transliteration could also be "av" or "af", according to https://web.archive.org/web/20110809113951/http://www.passport.gov.gr/elot-743.html
double vowels ευ are transliterated as eu
double vowels ου are transliterated as ouISO 843 also includes a system for transcription, referred to as "Type 2" in the protocol.
