The Ministry of Economy (Hebrew: משרד הכלכלה, Misrad HaKalkala) is a ministry of the Israeli government that oversees commerce, industry and labor in Israel.
The ministry was established in 1948 as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 1977 the Tourism Ministry post was added to it, becoming the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Tourism. However, the merger was reversed in 1981 and the office was renamed Ministry of Industry and Trade. Labor, which had been merged with the Welfare Ministry in the 1970s, was appended to the portfolio in 2003.
