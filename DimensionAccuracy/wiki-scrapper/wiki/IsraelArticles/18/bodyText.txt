The Malwathu Oya  (Sinhala: මල්වතු ඔය Malwathu Oya, Tamil: அருவி ஆறு Aruvi Aru), at 164 km (102 mi) long, is the second longest river in Sri Lanka. The river originates in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka and enters the sea on the northwest coast, into the Gulf of Mannar, near Vankalai. It is a seasonal river that spans over 164 kilometers through paddy and forest lands, which are used by the inhabitants to cultivate for their survival.
The river basin covers an area of 3,284 km (1,268 sq mi) (with a length of 125 km (78 mi), a maximum width of 40 km (25 mi) at an average height of 85.5 m (281 ft) above sea level).
