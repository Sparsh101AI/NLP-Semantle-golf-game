The Esuvii (or Esubii; Gaulish: Esuuii) were a Gallic tribe dwelling between the lower Seine and the Loire rivers, in what is now Normandy, during the Iron Age.
Their tribal name appears to be related to the theonym Esus.
The Esuvii lived at the time of the Gallic Wars (58–50 BC) around the present-day town of Sées (Orne), between the Coriosolites and the Aulerci.
