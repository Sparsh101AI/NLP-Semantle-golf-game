Braddock Road is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Alexandria, Virginia, United States. The station was opened on December 17, 1983, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for both the Blue and Yellow Lines, the station is located at Braddock Road and West Street.
Originally scheduled to open in summer 1982, its opening was delayed because of both unavailability of new subway cars and the lack of a test track. Construction of the station was complete by summer 1982, and in September 1983 Metro announced the station would open that December as the new cars would be ready for service. The station opened on December 17, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of 4.2 miles (6.8 km) of rail between National Airport and Huntington and the opening of the Eisenhower Avenue, Huntington and King Street–Old Town stations.
In 2014, the Metroway Bus Rapid Transit system began service with Braddock Road station serving as the southern terminus.
In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Blue and Yellow Lines south of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station, including the Braddock Road station, would be closed from May to September 2019, during which the platforms at this station would be rebuilt.
Access to the island platform is provided by one pair of escalators and one elevator. West of the platform are the three tracks of the RF&P Subdivision, which carry Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express trains, while east of the platform are bus bays serving DASH and Metrobus and a small metered parking lot.
