Forbes compiles the finances of all 30 NBA teams to produce an annual ranking of the best franchises in terms of valuation. The valuations are composed of the monetary worth of the sport, market, stadium deals, and brand. These areas are supported by applying financial metrics such as debt and operating income to each one.
The latest ranking reported that the New York Knicks is the most valuable NBA franchise after the 2020–21 NBA season. The fastest growing NBA franchise is the Philadelphia 76ers, with a 104.2% increase in valuation since the 2016–17 NBA season ($1.2 to $2.45 billion). The Knicks have held the title for the highest valuation since the 18th edition of this ranking, which was published after the conclusion of the 2014–15 NBA season.
Several media outlets have referenced in related news or conducts analytic journalism when the ranking comes out, such as The New York Times and Sports Illustrated. The NBA has consistently recognized the renditions of the ranking. The report has also applied more context to NBA trends, such as the financial impact of Ja Morant leveraging the Memphis Grizzlies into playoff relevancy. Financial trends in terms of 1-year increases have been more favorable for Memphis, most notably revenue after acquiring Ja Morant.
