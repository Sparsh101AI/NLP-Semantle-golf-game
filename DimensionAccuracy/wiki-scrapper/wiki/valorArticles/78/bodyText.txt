The 2020 Atlanta Braves season was the Braves' 55th season in Atlanta, 150th overall, and fourth season at Truist Park.
On March 12, 2020, MLB announced that because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the regular season would be delayed by at least two weeks in addition to the remainder of spring training being cancelled. Four days later, it was announced that the start of the season would be pushed back indefinitely due to the recommendation made by the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for eight weeks. On June 23, commissioner Rob Manfred unilaterally implemented a 60-game season. Players reported to training camps on July 1 in order to resume spring training and prepare for a July 24 Opening Day. The Braves began the season at the New York Mets on July 24 and ended the season at home against the Boston Red Sox on September 27.
Due to the pandemic and the shortened season, Major League Baseball instituted certain rule changes which included the use of a universal designated hitter, a runner on second base to start extra innings, and a revised schedule.
In a series against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Marcell Ozuna and Adam Duvall became the first pair of teammates in MLB history to hit three home runs in consecutive games, Ozuna doing so on September 1 and Duvall on September 2. In their game against the Miami Marlins on September 9, the Braves scored 29 runs, one short of the MLB record set by the Texas Rangers in 2007. On September 22, the Braves clinched the NL East for the third straight year with a 11–1 win over the Miami Marlins. They then swept the Cincinnati Reds in the 2020 National League Wild Card Series for their first post-season series win since the 2001 season. They also swept the Miami Marlins in the 2020 National League Division Series and advanced to the 2020 National League Championship Series, their first NLCS appearance since 2001. They lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS after leading 3–1.
The Braves led MLB in hits (556), doubles (130), runs batted in (338), on-base percentage (.349), on-base plus slugging (.832), total bases (1,001) and plate appearances (2,344).

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the regular season was shortened to 60 games with teams playing 10 games against each other member of their division while also playing four games against each team in the corresponding division in the other league. The Braves will, therefore, play 10 games against each team in their division and four games against each team in the American League East Division. On July 6, MLB announced the Braves' 60-game schedule which will begin on July 24 and end on September 27.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting proposed shortened season, teams started the season with a 30-man roster. The rosters were reduce to 28 after two weeks and then to the new-normal roster size of 26 after that.
