Lewisville is a town in Forsyth County, North Carolina, United States. The population was 13,388 at the 2020 census, up from 12,639 in 2010. It is a Piedmont Triad community.
Lewisville is a residential community of more than 13,000 people in western Forsyth County. While the town was incorporated in 1991, it has a long history as a township, dating back to the 1700s.
One of the reasons the residents decided to incorporate was to retain the town's small-town feel. A great deal of time and effort have gone into planning for future growth. The town square is the focal point for the downtown, setting the tone for that future development. Shallowford Square is the setting for many of the town's family-oriented activities and it continues to foster a real sense of community in Lewisville. From its first days as a community, where rugged pioneers loaded Nissen wagons with provisions preparing to cross the Shallow Ford as they embarked on a great adventure westward, Lewisville has embodied, in its very essence, a sense of community, a spirit of independence and a determination to guide its own future.
It was from this foundation of community spirit and involvement that residents, in 1991, took steps to incorporate the town. The goal was not to keep Lewisville from being annexed by another municipality, but rather it was so residents could guide the town's future, manage its growth and preserve the unique character that was being threatened by unplanned, often irresponsible development.
In developing the town's Town Charter, the founding residents held three principles as the foundation for the community.
First was the unwavering belief that governing begins with its residents, not dictated to them from elected officials. That's why today Lewisville has a number of committees and boards that are specifically created to develop and review policy recommendations for the elected Council to consider.
In those instances, when issues come before the Council for consideration independent of the committee/board process, the Council will generally refer them to a committee or board for review or recommendation prior to taking any action. Participation on committees and boards is open to all residents and, like during the earliest days as a community, it is volunteers who share a genuine concern for the town, who are helping to chart the community's future. Lewisville is truly unique in this respect.
The second principle is the almost sacred commitment to retain and preserve as much of Lewisville's small town character and charm as possible.  The community has some of the most demanding requirements for development of any community in North Carolina. These requirements are very specific about what types of development the town will allow and how it will allow that development to occur. One of the first tasks tackled as a community was to develop a Comprehensive Plan setting the vision for the future. Guided by community volunteers the plan serves as a blueprint for growth and is revised every five years with significant community engagement.
From this plan the town has developed a number of innovative tools to manage growth including the Lewisville Downtown Overlay, Vienna Business District and the Rural Overlay. Each is crafted to allow growth yet preserve the natural character and “essence” of the community.
The third principle the founders had in mind was a limited government – one that was empowered only to manage the essential services desired by residents. Land planning, road and facility maintenance, public safety, solid waste collection, recycling and parks & recreational activities for its citizens are among those services that its residents deem appropriate to be provided by the town. Others may be added in the future, but only after they receive a critical review and recommendation by its citizen committees and boards.
At times Lewisville has failed to uphold these founding principles. One such occasion was the forced annexation of the Vienna community in order to increase the town's tax base. Lewisville annexed this community over the objection of the majority of the residents. The annexation of the Vienna community has put an unwanted burden on the residents and business in the form of taxes and zoning restrictions. While the town continues to complete improvements to the downtown area little has been done to improve the Vienna area.

Although the community marked its 150th anniversary in 2009, Lewisville was not incorporated until August 13, 1991.
Lewisville's early formation and its current approach to planning and growth was influenced by the problems encountered by its neighboring suburb, Clemmons, which was noted for over-commercialization of its downtown area. Lewisville responded with planning that included a ban on drive-through restaurants, the creation of several parks (including one located in the town center), and other features aimed at preserving a small town feel.
