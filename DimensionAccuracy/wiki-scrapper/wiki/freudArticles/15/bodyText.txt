Telefe Tucumán is a television station broadcasting on analog channel 8 in San Miguel de Tucumán, the capital of the Argentine province of Tucumán. It is an owned-and-operated station of the Telefe television network.
Canal 8 signed on in 1983. It was one of the members of the Televisión Federal, S.A., consortium, that acquired the license for channel 11 Buenos Aires when it was privatized in 1989.
In 2018, all of Telefe's stations in interior Argentina dropped their channel number branding to go by "Telefe (city)", including Canal 8, which became Telefe Tucumán; this was done in preparation for the end of analog television.
Within a few months of beginning transmission, Canal 8 aired its first newscast, called 12 Minutos (12 Minutes). The newscast eventually was changed to a one-hour show, and the name was changed to División Noticias (News Division).
Canal 8 presents music programs such as Conexión Videos, Musica Libre (Free Music), and Elegidos (Elected), which aired from 1987 to 2008.
It has produced series for children and teens such as El Jardín de Florencia Flor (Florencia Flor's Garden), El Payaso Tapalín (The Tapalín Clown), and Tevematch.
Commented Third Time is the first sports show of the channel. Canal 8 was the first channel in the province to air live sporting events.
In the early 1990s the station showed a miniseries set in the Tucumán of the 17th Century called 100 Años Después (After 100 Years).
Canal 8 was the first channel in the area to rebroadcast news programs from Buenos Aires such as 28 Millones (later called 30 millones), Realidad 84 (Reality 84), Redacción Abierta (Open Drafting), and Buenas Noches Argentina (Good Night Argentina).
