On November 30, 2004, VH1 Classic Europe featured a program with 1980s music videos, "So 80s", after the launch of this channel. Since December 2005, VH1 Classic Europe featured thematic programs with clips from the 1980s:
The 80s Alternative - Alternative and obscure videos from the 1980s.
The 80s Chilled - Laid back music from the 1980s.

The 80s Rocked - Rock music from the 1980s.
The 80s Years - A selection of music videos from one particular year of the 1980s.On September 4, 2006, "So 80s" was renamed to "We Are The 80s". In 2007, VH1 Classic Europe started broadcasting a morning program with 80s music videos - "The 80s At 8" - from 08:00 to 09:00 CET. On July 1, 2012, VH1 Classic Europe cancelled all of these programs. In April 2015, VH1 Classic Europe started a marathon of 80s music videos – "Nothing But The 80s", which was released every three weeks – on weekends. On January 8, 2018, another program appeared on VH1 Classic Europe - "80s Boys vs 80s Girls". At the end of June 2018, on VH1 Classic Europe  discontinued "80s Boys vs 80s Girls", and in September of this year, "Nothing But The 80s" was also cancelled. In April 2020, VH1 Classic Europe cancelled "We Are The 80s", in connection with the move of MTV 80s to the frequency of this channel, which was previously broadcast on MTV Classic UK.
From February 28 to March 31, 2020, MTV 80s was broadcast for one month as a themed alternative to its host channel, MTV Classic UK, but was not planned as a full-time replacement. From June 31, 2020, until October 5, 2020, VH1 Classic Europe broadcast a block of MTV 80s programming from midnight until midday as a test bed for what would eventually become the permanent replacement to VH1 Classic Europe.
Since July 6, 2020, MTV 80s broadcasts in New Zealand around the clock replacing MTV Classic (Australia).
On October 5, 2020, from 05:00 CET onwards, MTV 80s started broadcasting full time, replacing VH1 Classic in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. The last video to be broadcast on VH1 Classic Europe was "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen. The first video on MTV 80s channel was "Never Let Me Down Again" by Depeche Mode at 05:00 CET.
Captions with the name of the song, album and the executor of music video are stylised in the same way that would have been used in the 1980s.
On March 1, 2021, MTV 80s expanded its broadcast area to the Middle East and North Africa through beIN Network.
As part of restructuring at Paramount Global UK & Australia, MTV 80s replaced MTV Classic in the UK from 6am on March 31, 2022.
Since its launch, MTV 80s has been broadcasting in the format of the British music channel Now 80s. Unlike Now 80s, MTV 80s doesn't broadcast any announcements nor commercial advertising.
MTV 80s uses the same equipment become outdated for broadcasting of programs, as the former VH1 Classic had. It is the only MTV channel which broadcasts in the 4:3 format.
