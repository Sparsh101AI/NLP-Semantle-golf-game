Veganmania festivals in Switzerland have been organised by Swissveg since 2011. The 2016 edition of Veganmania Aarau attracted 5,000 visitors, making it the largest of all vegan festivals in Switzerland. Previous editions were held in Winterthur, but due to a lack of space to accommodate the attendees, the organisation chose to move the festival to Aarau. The Gossau Veganmania, also organised by Swissveg, was held first in 2017, then featuring 60 stands.
Veganmania in Poland has been more than 8 major cities, with the 2019 Łódź edition attracting over 3,000 visitors. The 2020 Łódź edition had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
