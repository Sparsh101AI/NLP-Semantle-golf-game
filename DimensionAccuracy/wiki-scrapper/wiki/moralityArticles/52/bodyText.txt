The Tābiʿū al-Tābʿīn (Arabic: تَابِعُو ٱلتَّابِعِينَ, singular Arabic: تَابِعُ ٱلتَّابِعِينَ) is the generation after the Tābi‘ūn in Islam.
The first generation of Muslims are known as the Sahabah or the companions of Muhammad. The second generation of Muslims which come after the ṣaḥābah are called Tābi‘ūn (also "the successors"). The third generation of Muslims coming after the Tābi‘ūn, who knew at least one Tābi‘, are called tābi‘ al-tābi‘īn. The three generations make up the salaf of Islam.
The Sunnis define a Tābiʿ al-Tābʿīn as a Muslim who: 
Saw at least one of the Tābiʿun.
Was rightly guided. (That would be, according to Sunnis, one who adheres to the beliefs and actions of the Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jama'ah).
And the one who died in that state.  Sunnis consider the Tabi' al-Tabi'un  as the best generation after the Tābiʿun.According to them Muhammad said, "The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them (Tābiʿun), and then those coming after (the second generation)" Sahih Bukhari
