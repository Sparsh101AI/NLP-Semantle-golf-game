"Follow Your Daughter Home" is a song written by Burton Cummings, Donnie McDougall, Garry Peterson, Bill Wallace, and Kurt Winter and performed by The Guess Who.  It reached #20 in Canada and #61 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1973.  The song was also released in the United Kingdom as a single, but it did not chart.  The song was featured on their 1973 album, Artificial Paradise. The song has a calypso-influenced melody.
Lyrically, the song tells listeners to keep tabs on their daughters and to "keep her out of mischief".  Controversially, the song asks "is she still a virgin" and -- in addition to advising the listener to follow her home and "ask a lot of questions 'bout the boy she's sleeping with" -- gives advice to "tie her up".
The song was produced by Jack Richardson.
