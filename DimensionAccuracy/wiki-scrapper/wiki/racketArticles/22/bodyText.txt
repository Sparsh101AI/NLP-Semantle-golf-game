Urak Lawoi’ or Urak Lawoc (Urak Lawoi': อูรักลาโวยจ, IPA: [ˈurʌk ˈlawʊjʔ]) is an Aboriginal Malay language of southern Thailand.
The Orang (Suku) Laut who live between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula speak divergent Malayic lects, which bear some intriguing connections to various Sumatran Malay varieties.
In closed syllables, some vowels change their quality:
/a/ becomes [ʌ] (/ˈrawak/ [ˈraˑwʌk] "space").
/i/ becomes [ɪ] (/ˈbaliʔ/ [ˈbaˑlɪʔ] "return").
/o/ becomes [ʊ] (/ˈproc/ [ˈprʊiʔ] "stomach").
Epenthetic /j/ and /w/ were added after high vowels /i/, /u/, respectively (/ˈsiˑjak/ "light", /ˈbuˑwak/ "to throw away").
Vowels are somewhat lengthened in stressed open syllables allophonically.
Vowels other than /ə/ are slightly nasalized after nasal consonant, next syllables containing /w/, /j/ in upsets are further nasalized (/məˈnaŋɛh/ [məˈnãˑŋɛ̃h] "to cry", /ˈɲawa/ [ˈɲãˑw̃ã] "body, self").Notes: In the Thai script, the left column represents diacritics for open syllables, while the right one for closed syllables. For syllables with vowel ö, before consonants k, m, n, ng, p, and t, the vowel is not reflected. Similarly, the diacritic for a is not used before q. Any vowels with separate closed syllable diacritics have inherent value of /-ʔ/ when not used with succeeding consonant.
[t͡ɕ] and [t͡ɕʰ] allophones are influenced by Thai, whereas [d͡ʒ] is influenced by Malay.
Aspirated consonants and /f/ only appear in loanwords (that are mostly from Thai).
Phonetically, /-c/ and /-s/ is pronounced [-jʔ], and [-jh] (after back vowels and /a/) or [-h] (after front vowels), respectively, in syllable finals.
/l/ becomes [l] after /i/, /ə/, otherwise [ɭ] in syllable-final positions (/ˈlihəl/ [ˈliˑhəl] "space" vs. /ˈbumɔl/ [ˈbuˑmɔɭ] "doctor").
/ər/ are compensatorily lengthened to phonetically long [əə]. In stressed positions, the vowel cluster fluctuates between [ɽ], [ər], [rə].
The coda stop /k/ after a front vowel becomes [kx] (/ˈkamek/ [ˈkaˑmekx] "sheep").
The stops /p/, /b/ initially in a syllable with a back vowel and the coda /c/ labialized /pw/ and /bw/, respectively (/səˈboc/ [səˈbwʊjʔ] "to utter")./-j/ and /-w/ could be treated as a part of diphthongs or triphthongs.
/-l/ only exists in Phuket dialect.Urak Lawoi' does not have tones, except in Thai loans. Words are usually stressed in penultimate syllable, except if it the expected stress is placed in pre-syllable (e.g. open syllables containing /ə/, but not /ər/) the stress moves into the next syllable. Urak Lawoi' also has the intonation for the whole sentence. For example, the interrogative sentences have raising intonation, and the negative sentences have lower-pitch intonation.
