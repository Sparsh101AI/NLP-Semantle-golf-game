Tula (died 3 October 1795), also known as Tula Rigaud, was an African man enslaved on the island of Curaçao, in the Dutch West Indies, who liberated himself and led the Curaçao Slave Revolt of 1795. The revolt, which began on 17 August 1795, lasted for more than a month. He was executed on 3 October 1795. He is revered on Curaçao today as a fighter for human rights and independence.
The Tula Museum is a museum dedicated to Tula and his revolt, and is located in the Knip Plantation where the revolt started.
The film Tula: The Revolt (2013) is based on Tula's life story.
