Semai (engrok Semai) is a Austroasiatic language of western Malaysia spoken by about 44,000 Semai people. It is one of the few Aslian language which is not endangered, and even has 2,000 monolingual speakers. 
One notable aspect of Semai phonology is its highly irregular pattern of expressive reduplication, showing discontiguous copying from just the edges of the reduplicant's base, thus forming a minor syllable.
Examples of words in Semai include the following:
Asli (2017), a film directed by David Liew is about a bi-racial girl on a road to discover her cultural heritage, is the first film to use the Semai language in 50% of its dialogue.http://projekt.ht.lu.se/rwaai RWAAI (Repository and Workspace for Austroasiatic Intangible Heritage)
