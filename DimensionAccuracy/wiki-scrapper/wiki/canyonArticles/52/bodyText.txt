This is a list of urban areas in the United States as defined by the United States Census Bureau, ordered according to their 2010 census populations. An urbanized area (UA) is an urban area with population of 50,000 or more; an urban cluster (UC) has population less than 50,000. An urbanized area may serve as the core of a metropolitan statistical area, while an urban cluster may be the core of a micropolitan statistical area. The list includes urban areas with a population of at least 50,000.
For the 2010 census, the Census Bureau redefined the classification of urban areas to "a densely settled core of census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density requirements, along with adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core. To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified according to criteria must encompass at least 2,500 people, at least 1,500 of which reside outside institutional group quarters." These criteria result in several large urban agglomerations that encompass multiple urban areas from the 2000 census. The Census Bureau is currently considering whether to divide the larger agglomerations, but published potential agglomerations in August 2010.
