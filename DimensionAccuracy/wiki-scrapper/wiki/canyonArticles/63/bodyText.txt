Gross metropolitan product (GMP) is a monetary measure of the value of all final goods and services produced within a metropolitan statistical area during a specified period (e.g., a quarter, a year). GMP estimates are commonly used to compare the relative economic performance among such areas.
GMP is calculated annually by the Eurostat.
GMP is calculated annually by the Bureau of Economic Analysis within the United States Department of Commerce. This is done only for metropolitan areas and not for micropolitan areas, metropolitan divisions, combined statistical areas, and BEA economic areas.
