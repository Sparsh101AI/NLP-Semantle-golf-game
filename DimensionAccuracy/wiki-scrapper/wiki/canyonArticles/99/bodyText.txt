Clinton Township, officially the Charter Township of Clinton, is a charter township of Macomb County in the U.S. state of Michigan.  As of the 2020 census, the township had a total population of 100,513. It ranks as Michigan's most-populated township and 8th most-populated municipality overall.  
As a northern suburb of Metro Detroit, Clinton is about 10 miles (16 km) north of the city of Detroit.  The township is home to many parks, notably George George Memorial Park. The main branch of the Clinton River, for which the township was named, runs through Clinton Township.
There are two unincorporated communities in the township/CDP:
Broad Acres is located in the southeastern portion on M-3/Gratiot Avenue between 15 Mile and Quinn Roads (42°32′57″N 82°54′08″W﻿ / ﻿42.54917°N 82.90222°W﻿ / 42.54917; -82.90222; Elevation: 610 ft./186 m.).
Cady is located in the southwestern portion at Utica and Moravian Roads (42°33′37″N 82°57′52″W﻿ / ﻿42.56028°N 82.96444°W﻿ / 42.56028; -82.96444; Elevation: 614 ft./187 m.). It was founded in 1833 by Chauncey G. Cady. Cady served for a time as township supervisor and was also a member of the state legislature. It had a post office from 1864 until 1906.The first settlement on the land currently known as Clinton Township was called Gnadenhuetten and established in 1782 by Rev. David Zeisberg, but closed in 1786. 
The township was organized as "Huron Township" on August 12, 1818, named after what was then known as the Huron River. Because of confusion with another Huron River south of Detroit, on July 17, 1824, the Michigan Territorial Legislature renamed both the township and the river after DeWitt Clinton, the popular governor of New York from 1817 to 1823 who was largely responsible for building the Erie Canal which enabled many settlers to come to Michigan.
Moravian Drive is the township's oldest road dating back to the days when the Moravian Missionaries settled to attempt to convert the local Native Americans.
Residents are served by the Clinton-Macomb Public Library. Clinton Township is also home of the Walker Goldie Institute. This organization is dedicated to the education of youth through teaching and after school programs. The organization was founded by Kimberly Hyde in 2007. It is currently inactive. https://michigan-company.com/co/walker-goldie-inc
