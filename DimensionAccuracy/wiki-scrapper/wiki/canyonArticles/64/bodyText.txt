Hog's pudding is a type of sausage produced in Cornwall and Devon. Popular variants of the recipe consist of pork meat and fat, suet, bread, as well as oatmeal or pearl barley formed into a large sausageâ€”also known as 'groats pudding' and are very similar to a white pudding, whereas other versions of the recipe contain  a high percentage of offal such as lung and liver and can more accurately be described as a sort of West Country haggis. It is much spicier than white pudding as it contains black pepper, cumin, basil and garlic. The sausage is usually around two inches in diameter.
