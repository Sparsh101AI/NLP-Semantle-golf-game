For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.  From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.  In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.
In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state.  In 1873, Scott County was established.

Scott County USD 466The Scott County Public Library is located at 110 West 8th in Scott City. The Scott County Library was the first free county public library in the state of Kansas. It was started in September 1923 with the five members of the library committee each checking out a book for herself and one for her husband thus the library checked out ten books on the first day that it was open. Two rooms on the second floor of the Cretcher Lumber Company office building were made available for the library. L. W. Cretcher, owner of the lumber yard, gave the library a boost by painting the rooms, furnishing a stove, shelves, cupboards, lights, and free rent. In November 1924 a proposal was placed on the ballot for the library to be a county funded entity. A room was set aside in the basement of the newly built courthouse for the library, which at that time possessed 861 books. The library in the courthouse was opened to the public in July 1925. The library remained in the basement of the Scott County Courthouse until a separate library building was constructed at 110 West 8th Street in 1964. This building was 4,150 square feet (386 m) with a 660-square-foot (61 m) meeting room available to the public. In 2004, the Scott County Library Board began a fundraising effort for a Library Building expansion of 7,350 feet (2,240 m). The Library expansion and remodel to 12,160 square feet (1,130 m) was completed in May 2009.
