The Gagauz Republic (Gagauz: Gagauz Respublikası; Romanian: Republica Găgăuzia; Russian: Республика Гагаузия, Respublika Gagauzija) was an unrecognised state that separated from Moldova during the dissolution of the Soviet Union but later peacefully joined  Moldova after being de facto independent from 1990 to 1994.
The Special Congress of Representatives of the Gagauz people was held on 12 November 1989, in which the Gagauz Republic was proclaimed in the Moldavia, but on the next day the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Moldavia abolished the Special Congress decisions, calling them unconstitutional.
The Congress of People's Deputies of the Steppe South of the Moldavia declared independence from the Moldavia and the establishment of the Gagauz Republic on 19 August 1990. Two days later, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Moldavia held an emergency meeting, and a decision was reached to declare the republic illegal and the congress unconstitutional. A detachment of Moldovan volunteers and police units were sent to Gagauzia to quell the dissidence, but the arrival of SSV soldiers prevented bloodshed.
In December 1994, on the basis of agreements reached by the Gagauz Republic and the Republic of Moldova, a document on the peaceful integration of Gagauzia with autonomous rights was signed. The integration was carried out from December 1994 to June 1995, when the Gagauz Republic legally dissolved and became the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia.
