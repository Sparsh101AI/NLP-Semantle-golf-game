Lijiang started from the Yuan Dynasty to the 13th year of the Yuan Dynasty (1276) and set up the administrative district Lijiang Road. 100,000 years ago, the Lijiang people of the late Paleolithic sapiens were active here. The discovery of cave paintings in the Jinsha River Valley and numerous new stone tools, bronzes and ironsmiths prove that Lijiang is one of the important areas of ancient human activities in southwest China. It was under the rule of the Mu family (木氏) native chieftains during the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty.
The Baisha Old Town was the political, commercial and cultural center for the local Naxi people and other ethnic groups for 400 years from the year 658 AD to 1107AD.

In ancient times, the Baisha Old Town used to be the center of silk embroidery in the southwest of China and the most important place of the Ancient Southern Silk Road, also called the Ancient Tea and Horse Road or Ancient tea route. The Ancient Southern Silk Road started from Burma, crossed Lijiang, Shangri-La County, Tibet, journeyed through Iran, the Fertile Crescent and ultimately to the  Mediterranean Sea.
In 2002 Lijiang City was established, replacing the former Lijiang Naxi Autonomous County.
