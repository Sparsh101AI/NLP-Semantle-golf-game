The Martinique national football team (French: Équipe de Martinique de football) represents the French overseas department and region of Martinique in international football. The team is controlled by the Ligue de Football de la Martinique (English: Martinique Football League), a local branch of French Football Federation (French: Fédération Française de Football). On 7 August 2010, the national team adopted the nickname Les Matinino, which pays tribute to the history of the island.
As an overseas department of the French Republic, Martinique is not a member of FIFA and is therefore not eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup or any competition organised first-hand by the organisation. Martiniquais, being French citizens, are eligible to play for the France national football team. Martinique is, however, a member of CONCACAF and CFU and is eligible for all competitions organised by either organisation. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): "[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them."'
Martinique's highest honour to date was winning the Caribbean Cup in 1993. Martinique also was a two-time winner of the CFU Championship, a precursor to the Caribbean Cup. A more recent success was winning the 2010 Coupe de l'Outre-Mer. The team defeated Réunion 5–3 on penalties to claim the title. The national team has participated in three CONCACAF Gold Cups and its best finish in the competition was in 2002 when the team reached the quarterfinals where they lost to Canada 6–5 on penalties.
