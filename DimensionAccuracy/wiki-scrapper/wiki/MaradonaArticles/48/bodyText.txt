The Vietnam women's national football team (Vietnamese: Đội tuyển Bóng đá Nữ Quốc gia Việt Nam) is a women's football team representing Vietnam and controlled by Vietnam Football Federation (VFF). The team is currently ranked 32nd in the world by FIFA.
Vietnam women's football established in 1990, but it wasn't until 1997 that the women's team had the first match. The team has become one of the most powerful football women's team in Southeast Asia since 2001 with Thailand. Vietnam cemented its position in the region by winning gold medals at the AFF Women's Championship in 2006, 2012 and 2019. Also, in the SEA Games women's level, Vietnam also cemented its position, winning gold in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2009, 2017, 2019 and 2021 editions.
Being a major powerhouse football in Southeast Asia, however Vietnam has fallen short in continental tournaments like the AFC Women's Asian Cup and Asian Games. Vietnam first qualified for the Women's Asian Cup in 1999 and has since maintained the qualifying streak, and had hosted the competitions twice, first in 2008 and second in 2014, but Vietnam failed to progress from the group stage each time. To make the matter worse, Vietnam even missed out the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in a painful playoff defeat at home to arch-rival Thailand 1–2.
At the Asian Games, Vietnam first participated in the 1998 Asian Games in Thailand, and for the first four editions, Vietnam had little to impress, and Vietnam's first win only came in the 2010 Asian Games. Vietnam made a major breakthrough at the 2014 Asian Games, finishing fourth place for the first time. Vietnam again progressed from the group stage in the 2018 Asian Games, but failed to Chinese Taipei after penalty shootout.
In the pre-2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup friendlies in Spain, Vietnam's perpetration had been plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic as several players were found to be infected with the virus. However, the Vietnamese side was able to have enough players for the group stage, where they lost to two Asian powerhouses South Korea and Japan both by 0–3. The Vietnamese team finally reached the quarter-finals of a Women's Asian Cup for the first-time after a struggling 2–2 draw with Myanmar, which also effectively knocked the Burmese out of the tournament. In Vietnam's first knockout phase experience, Vietnam lost to China at the quarterfinals, then entered the playoff phase against old foes Thailand and Chinese Taipei. This time, with Thailand and Chinese Taipei plagued by coronavirus, Vietnam was able to win the playoff round, thus qualified for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, their first World Cup in history. The successful participation of Vietnam women's team has been notable after a string of football reforms initiated since late 2010s to promote women's football at universal level such as schools, universities and companies after the failure to qualify for the 2015 Women's World Cup, though challenges have persisted due to cultural issues. To further improve Vietnam women's football standard, an attempt to create an independent development fund for women's football has been underlined, while calls to professionalise the domestic league have also been taken for the first time.
