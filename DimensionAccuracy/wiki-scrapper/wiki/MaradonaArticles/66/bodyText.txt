John Lowe MBE (born 21 July 1945) is an English former professional darts player. Along with Eric Bristow and Jocky Wilson, he was known for dominating darts during the 1980s. Lowe was world champion on three occasions, in 1979, 1987 and 1993. He was also a two-time winner of the Winmau World Masters and a two-time World Cup singles champion. In total, Lowe won 15 BDO and WDF majors. He held the World No. 1 ranking on four occasions. In October 1984, he became the first player to hit a televised nine-dart finish. 
Lowe is one of only six players to have won the World Championship three or more times, and was the first person to win it in three separate decades; along with Phil Taylor, he remains one of only two players to achieve this. Amidst growing dissatisfaction with the British Darts Organisation, Lowe was also one of 16 players who in 1993 broke away to form their own governing body, the World Darts Council (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation).
Lowe won the World Championship title in three different decades – 1979, 1987 and 1993. He met Eric Bristow six times in the World Championship in various semi-finals and finals, and it was not until his fourth attempt (in the 1987 final) that he managed to overcome his rival. His record against Bristow in majors was three wins and six defeats.
Lowe achieved the first ever televised nine-dart finish (the sport's equivalent of a 147 break in snooker) on 13 October 1984 during the World Matchplay tournament against Keith Deller, although it was not live and instead shown on a highlights programme on ITV. It was achieved via a rare third visit combination of treble 17, treble 18 and double 18. Lowe won £102,000 for this success. He went on to win the tournament.
In addition to his three world titles, Lowe has also won two World Masters titles, two British Open titles, two British Matchplay championships, two World Cup Singles, and three European Cup Singles Titles, as well as other titles around the world in his career. He played for England over 100 times and was captain for seven years, during which time his team were unbeaten.
Lowe gained credit for his decorum and sportsmanship at the oche, often in contrast to Eric Bristow. Lowe was also probably unique in darts in that he looked after his health, never developing the weight difficulties associated with darts players, though he did consume alcohol onstage alongside other players when it was still permitted during matches.
Nicknames have always been common in darts, but Lowe never really had one which caught on. A composed performer, he did not have anything which stood out in his demeanour or personality – until someone decided to use these traits to come up with the nickname of "Old Stoneface". This is also the title of Lowe's autobiography which was published in 2005.
Lowe has enjoyed a longevity at the sport. He played in the televised stages of the World Championship for a then record 28 consecutive years, from the inaugural championship in 1978 to his last appearance in 2005 where he was defeated by the Canadian John Verwey in a final leg tie-break.
Lowe played at the Alexandra Palace in 1980 in front of 7,000 people in the News of the World Championship.
Lowe was secretary of the World Professional Dart Players Association (later to become the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA)), and in 2005, enjoyed a testimonial year in the sport to commemorate his 30th year as a professional. He attempted to qualify for the World Championship each year until 2008, but fell short in the early qualifying rounds. After joining a short-lived venture, the Setanta Sports-televised BetFred League of Legends in 2008, Lowe became ineligible to compete at the PDC World Championship so could not attempt to qualify for the 2009 event.
In May 2009, Lowe released a book, The Art of Darts, in which he offered his personal insights into the game to both amateur and aspiring professional dart players. In 2013, The Art of Darts was produced in app-form for the iPhone and iPad.
In 2014, Lowe was one of several celebrities to take part in ITV's new game show Amazing Greys, in which members of the public take on icons of British sport and entertainment.
Lowe was born in New Tupton, Derbyshire. He is married to Karen and lives in Chesterfield. They both support Sunderland football club.
