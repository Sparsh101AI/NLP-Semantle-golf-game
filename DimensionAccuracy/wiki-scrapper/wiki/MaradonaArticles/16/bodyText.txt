The Mexico national beach soccer team represents Mexico in international Beach Football competitions and is controlled by the FEMEXFUT, the governing body for football in Mexico. Mexico have a relatively short beach soccer history, which means the key figures in their recent success remain a part of the national team set-up.
In addition to team victories, Mexico players have won individual awards at FIFA World Youth Cups.
