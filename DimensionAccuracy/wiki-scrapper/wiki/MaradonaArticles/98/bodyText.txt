The Gloucestershire Echo is a local weekly newspaper based in Gloucester, England. Published every Thursday, it covers the areas of Bishops Cleeve, Cheltenham, Moreton-in-Marsh, Northleach, Stow-on-the-Wold and Tewkesbury. The newspaper is headquartered at Gloucester Quays.
The Gloucestershire Echo was founded in 1873.
In 2012, Local World acquired owner Northcliffe Media from Daily Mail and General Trust. The newspaper is now owned by Reach plc, publisher of the Daily Express and Daily Mirror national newspapers.
Until it went weekly with its October 12, 2017 issue, the Gloucestershire Echo was a six-day-a-week daily newspaper produced by Gloucestershire Media, part of Reach plc.
