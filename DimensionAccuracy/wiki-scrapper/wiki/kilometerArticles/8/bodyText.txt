The ISO 15706-2 is the ISO standard, an extension to the existing 2002 published standard ISO 15706:2002. The ISO 15706-2 is the Information and documentation — International Standard Audiovisual Number — Part 2: Version identifier.
ISO 15706-2:2007 establishes a voluntary system for the identification of versions of audiovisual works and other content derived from or closely related to an audiovisual work. It is based on the International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) system defined in ISO 15706:2002. An ISAN combined with the version segment, as specified in ISO 15706-2:2007 constitutes an ISAN version identifier, is referred to as a V-ISAN. A V-ISAN is a registered, globally unique identifier for versions of an audiovisual work and related content.
ISO 15706-2:2007 specifies the basic systems and procedures to support the issuance and administration of V-ISANs.
