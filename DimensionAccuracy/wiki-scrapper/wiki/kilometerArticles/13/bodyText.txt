A whip pan is a type of pan shot in which the camera pans so quickly that the picture blurs into indistinct streaks. It is commonly used as a transition between shots, and can indicate the passage of time or a frenetic pace of action.
This technique is used liberally by directors Anatole Litvak, Sam Raimi, Damien Chazelle, Wes Anderson and Edgar Wright. It is also frequently seen in 1970s martial arts movies. In Victor Lewis-Smith's satirical series TV Offal it was used frequently either as a means of transitioning  between wildly different subjects, or as punctuation to a particularly scathing joke at someone's expense.
