The production schedule is a project plan of how the production budget will be spent over a given timescale, for every phase of a business project.
The scheduling process starts with the script, which is analysed and broken down, scene by scene, onto a sequence of breakdown sheets, each of which records the resources required to execute the scene. These resources include:
Cast Actors
Special Effects
Wardrobe
Special Equipment
Stunts
Extras/Silent Bits
Props
Make-up/Hair
Extras/Atmosphere
Vehicles/Animals
Sound Effects/Music
Production Notes
OthersFrom the breakdown sheets, the Production Manager compiles a production board which is used as the basis for a shooting schedule for every day of the shoot.
