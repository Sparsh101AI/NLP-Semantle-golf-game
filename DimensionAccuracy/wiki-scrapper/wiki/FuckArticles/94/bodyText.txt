Swinburne University of Technology (often simply called Swinburne) is a public research university based in Melbourne, Australia. It was founded in 1908 as the Eastern Suburbs Technical College by George Swinburne to serve those without access to further education in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. Its main campus is in Hawthorn, a suburb of Melbourne, 7.5 km from the Melbourne central business district.
In addition to its main Hawthorn campus, it has campuses in the Melbourne metropolitan area at Wantirna and Croydon; in Sarawak, Malaysia; and in Sydney.
In the 2020 Student Experience Survey, Swinburne was ranked equal 1st place in Victoria for the ’entire education experience’ for undergraduate students, with an overall satisfaction rate of 80 per cent. Swinburne is the only academic institution in Melbourne that offers pilot training from the aviation degrees.
Swinburne University of Technology has its origins in the Eastern Suburbs Technical College, which was established in 1908 in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn by George Swinburne. In 1913, the institution changed its name from Hawthorn College to Swinburne Technical College. It later became known as the Swinburne Institute of Technology.
In the late 1980s, the Outer Eastern University Planning Council advocated for a new university to be established in outer eastern Melbourne. The area had the second lowest university participation rate in Melbourne, after the Mornington Peninsula. Partially in response to this advocacy, in 1990 Swinburne established it's "Eastern Campus" in Mooroolbark (sometimes described as Lilydale), on the site of the recently closed MDA Grammar School. However, students could not attend until 1992 due to council planning negotiation, and the campus was officially opened on 6 April 1992. By 1993, it was known as the "Mooroolbark Campus".
The Dawkins reforms to Australian higher education in the early 1990s lead to many tertiary colleges being merged or split-up, and many given university status.
On 1 January 1992, the university was given the Prahran Campus of Victoria College and the co-located Prahran College of TAFE, both of which had evolved from the Prahran Mechanics' Institute (established in 1854).
Swinburne attained university status on 1 July 1992 with the passage of the Swinburne University of Technology Act.
In 1997, Swinburne opened a campus at Lilydale, replacing it's nearby one at Mooroolbark. In 1998, it merged with the Outer East Institute of TAFE and began operating from campuses at Croydon and Wantirna.
In 1999, Swinburne established the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA).
In 2000, the university opened a campus in Sarawak, Malaysia, as a partnership between the university and the Sarawak State Government.
In 2008, it collaborated with two other universities in forming The Centre for Social Impact.  In February 2011, the university opened the Advanced Technologies Centre, a 22,000 square metre building of modern architectural design at its Hawthorn campus, known locally as "the cheese grater building".
Following a series of funding cuts announced by the Victorian Government to vocational education in May 2012, Swinburne announced that it would close its Lilydale and Prahran campuses. Lilydale campus officially closed on 1 July 2013. The university sold its Prahran campus to the Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE in 2014. The Lilydale campus was taken over by Box Hill Institute in 2016.
In 2015, Swinburne launched its law school. Through a partnership with Leo Cussen Centre for Law, Swinburne Law School is the only law school in Victoria accredited by the Victorian Legal Admissions Board (VLAB) to enable students to accelerate their admission to legal practice by completing their practical legal training during the final year of their studies.
The Hawthorn campus is Swinburne's main campus. It hosts a range of vocational, undergraduate, and postgraduate programs.
Wantirna is a TAFE-specific campus. The campus also offers courses in areas including health and community services, visual arts, business and accounting.
The university's Croydon campus is a TAFE-specific campus, with a focus on training in trades such as building, carpentry, electrical and plumbing.
Swinburne no longer operates a "Prahran Campus" (occupying and replacing buildings of the previous by Prahran College). Currently it is the home of the National Institute of Circus Arts (NICA).
The Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus is located in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia.
The Parramatta campus is quite small and located in a public library building as a tenant. It has connections to Sydney's bus, tram, metro and train networks as well as having a large taxi rink attached to the building.
Swinburne Online is the online arm of the university. Swinburne Online was founded in 2011 after a 50-50 joint venture between Swinburne University of Technology and SEEK Learning seeking to capitalise on increasing demand for off-campus education.
Swinburne Online was originally created under the name Swinburne Direct, with an initial $10 million investment. It was formed to maximise the Australian Government's decision to lift caps on Commonwealth-supported university places from 2012, a policy which intended to increase the number of 25- to 34-year-olds with bachelor's degrees to 40 per cent by 2025.
Swinburne Online originally provided higher education degrees at both bachelor and masters level. As of April 2015, it offered over twenty courses in business, communication, design, education, and social science. However, as of September 2015, Swinburne Online has begun offering vocational education.
In April 2015, CEO Denice Pitt expressed a public desire to expand internationally to offer degrees to international students.
In 2014 Swinburne Online was ranked fourth in Australia's 100 fastest growing companies. Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew by 48% to $29.8 million in 2014–15.
As of September 2021, Swinburne has six research institutes:
Data Science Research Institute (launched 2017)
Iverson Health Innovation Research Institute (launched 2017)
Manufacturing Futures Research Institute (launched 2016)
Smart Cities Research Institute (launched 2017)
