Hutschenreuther is the name of a German family that established the production of porcelain in northern Bavaria, starting in 1814.
The Hutschenreuther porcelain business was founded in 1814 by Carolus Magnus Hutschenreuther (1794–1845) in Hohenberg an der Eger, Bavaria, Germany. He had previously worked at the Wallendorf porcelain manufactory in Lichte (Wallendorf).
After his death in 1845, the factory was headed by his widow, Johanna Hutschenreuther, and her two sons. A large part of the factory was destroyed by a fire in 1848, but it was rebuilt. From 1860, they produced hand-painted and gilded porcelain products.
In 1857, Lorenz Hutschenreuther, the elder son of Carolus Magnus Hutschenreuther, established a porcelain factory in Selb. They expanded from 1902 to 1969 and were named Porzellanfabriken Lorenz Hutschenreuther AG Selb (Lorenz Hutschenreuther Porcelain Factories Company, Selb).
