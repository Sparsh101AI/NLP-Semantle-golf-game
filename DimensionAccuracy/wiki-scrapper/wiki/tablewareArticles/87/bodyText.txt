This is a list of the catholicos-patriarchs of the Assyrian Church of the East. The Patriarch is the leader of the Assyrian Church of the East, that represents the traditionalist continuation of the ancient Church of the East.
During the period between the middle of the 16th century and the beginning of the 19th century, that was marked by several internal divisions, traditionalist branch of the Church of the East was represented at first by the senior Eliya line of patriarchs who resided in the Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh, and later also by the younger Shimun line of patriarch who resided in Qudshanis. Patriarchs of the Shimun line were traditionalists since the 17th century. In 1804, the last patriarch of the Eliya line died without successor, thus enabling the patriarch Shimun XVI (1780–1820) of the Qodshanis line to become the sole primate of the entire traditionalist branch of the Church of the East.
