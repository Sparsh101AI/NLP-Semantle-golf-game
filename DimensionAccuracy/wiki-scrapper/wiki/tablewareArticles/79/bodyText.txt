The Rocket Festival was a three-day festival of music, circus, performance art and sculpture set in Andalucia in southern Spain that was held in May 2005, 2006 and 2008.
The festival evolved from the free festival movement in the UK and inspired by events such as Glastonbury Festival  and Shambala Festival.
The organisers have a long history in the UK festival and free party scene from Stonehenge to Glastonbury. The Rocket was conceived as a melting-pot of this alternative festival culture with the Spanish fiesta spirit set in a rural location near Alhama de Granada, Andalucia.
