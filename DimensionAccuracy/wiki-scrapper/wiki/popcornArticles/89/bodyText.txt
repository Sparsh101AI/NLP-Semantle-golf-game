The 1999 Arizona Diamondbacks season was the franchise's 2nd season in Major League Baseball and their 2nd season at Bank One Ballpark and in Phoenix, Arizona. They began the season on April 5 at home against the Los Angeles Dodgers, and looked to improve on their 1998 expansion season. They looked to contend in what was a strong National League West Division. They finished the season with a highly surprising record of 100-62, good enough for the NL West division title, becoming the fastest expansion team in MLB history to reach the playoffs. They also set all-time franchise highs in hits (1,566), runs (908), batting average (.277), on-base percentage (.347), and slugging percentage (.459). In the NLDS, however, they fell in four games to the New York Mets on Todd Pratt's infamous home run. Randy Johnson would win the NL Cy Young Award and become the third pitcher to win the Cy Young Award in both leagues.
