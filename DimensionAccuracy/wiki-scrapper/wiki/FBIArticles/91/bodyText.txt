The Douglas XT-30 was a proposed American military advanced trainer. It was never built.
Intended to replace the North American T-6 Texan, the XT-30 was designed in 1948 for a United States Air Force competition. The design had an 800 hp (600 kW) Wright R-1300 radial mounted amidships behind the cockpit (in the fashion of the P-39), in a rather squared-off fuselage. The R-1300 drove a three-bladed propeller by way of an extension shaft (driveshaft). The XT-30 design seated pilot and pupil in tandem, under a framed greenhouse canopy and had a straight low wing.
Competing against the North American T-28 Trojan, the more complex XT-30 was not selected for production and none were built.
