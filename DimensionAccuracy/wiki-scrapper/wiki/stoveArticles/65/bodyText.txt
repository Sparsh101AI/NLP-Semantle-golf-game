The Lucchese School, also known as the School of Lucca and as the Pisan-Lucchese School, was a school of painting and sculpture that flourished in the 11th and 12th centuries in Pisa and Lucca in Tuscany with affinities to painters in Volterra.  The art is mostly anonymous.  Although not as elegant or delicate as the Florentine School, Lucchese works are remarkable for their monumentality.
