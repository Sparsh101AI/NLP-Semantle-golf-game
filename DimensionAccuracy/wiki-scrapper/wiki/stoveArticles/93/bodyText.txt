Great Britain, represented by the British Olympic Association (BOA), competed at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR. British athletes have competed in every Summer Olympic Games. 219 competitors, 149 men and 70 women, took part in 145 events in 14 sports.
Against the objections of the UK Government, the British Olympic Association allowed each sporting federation to decide on their participation in Moscow.
Equestrian, hockey, sailing and shooting decided to follow the American-led boycott. There was a partial boycott of the opening ceremony with Britain being represented solely by the General Secretary of the British Olympic Association, Dick Palmer, carrying the Olympic flag, and no athletes being present. In addition, the Olympic flag was raised for the British medal winners instead of the Union Flag and the Olympic anthem played instead of God Save the Queen for the five gold medalists.
