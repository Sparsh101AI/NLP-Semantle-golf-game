Aird of Sleat (Scottish Gaelic: Àird Shlèite) is a village on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is at the southern end of the Sleat peninsula, 4 miles (6 kilometres) southeast of Ardvasar and Armadale, at the end of a minor road. Lying 2 miles (3 kilometres) from Point of Sleat, it is the southernmost settlement on Skye.  A track leads from the village to the Point of Sleat Lighthouse.
The village is home to the Aird Old Church which is now converted into an art gallery.
