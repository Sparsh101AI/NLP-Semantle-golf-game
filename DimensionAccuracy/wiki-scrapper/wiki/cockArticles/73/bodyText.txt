During his time at King's College, Milner-White introduced the Service of Nine Lessons and Carols. This was first broadcast in 1928 and has now become a major part of the BBC's Christmas schedule. Milner-White was also instrumental in inspiring the composer Herbert Howells to write his Collegium Regale service settings when he challenged Howells to write music for King's College as part of a bet in 1941. Howells remarked that his composition was "the only Te Deum to be born of a decanal bet". The settings have since become a well known part of the Anglican church music repertoire.
Milner-White remained at King's until 1941, when he was appointed Dean of York. During his time as dean, he directed the replacement of many of York Minster's windows and undertook a great deal of writing on liturgical matters, for example My God My Glory (1954). He served on various national committees and served on the advisory council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1944 to 1959 due to his interest in stained-glass windows.
