This is a list of dignitaries at the state funeral of John F. Kennedy. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, and his state funeral took place on November 25, 1963, in Washington, D.C.
The gathering of dignitaries was considered the largest gathering of foreign statesmen in the history of the United States. It was also the largest gathering of foreign dignitaries at a state funeral since that of King Edward VII in London in 1910. Although the state funerals of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1969 and Ronald Reagan in 2004 had large gatherings of foreign dignitaries, the funeral of Kennedy was the largest gathering of foreign dignitaries at any funeral in the United States, drawing 220 foreign dignitaries from 92 foreign nations, including 19 heads of state and government. Eisenhower's drew 191 from 78 nations, while Reagan's drew 218 from 165 nations.
