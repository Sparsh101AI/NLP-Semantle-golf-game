Kue makmur (Malay: kuih makmur, Jawi: معمور) is a traditional Malay kue or kuih. This cake made from butter, ghee and flour, and served during special occasion of Eid al-Fitr. Kue makmur is identified with its white colour and usually in a round shape.
The origin of kue makmur is somewhat uncertain and believed to be derived from the Middle Eastern ma'amoul that was introduced by Arab merchants throughout the Malay Archipelago. Since then, kue makmur has been a part of the traditional kue or kuih of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. In 2015, kue makmur was featured in a series of Singaporean stamps. Loosely translated, they would be called "prosperous biscuits (UK)/cookies (US)".
