Dembow is a Dominican musical genre that can be traced to a riddim that originated in Jamaican dancehall. When Shabba Ranks released "Dem Bow" in 1990, it did not take long for the dembow genre to form. Riddims were built from the song and the sound became a popular part of reggaeton. It started in  PANANA when one of the 1st Spanish reggae artist came out and blew up by the name of El General. From there it took off in Dominican Republic  creating the sound UNDEGROUND largely known as reggaeton today. It hit the streets of New York making its way to all of Latin America.
The main element of dembow music is its rhythm, which is somewhat reminiscent of reggaeton and dancehall music, but with a more constant rhythm and faster beats per minute than reggaeton.  Rhythm and melodies in dembow tend to be simple and repetitive.
