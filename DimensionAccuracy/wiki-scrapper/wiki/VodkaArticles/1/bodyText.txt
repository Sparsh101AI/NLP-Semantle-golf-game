Herbs de Majorca (Catalan: Herbes de Mallorca; Spanish: Hierbas Mallorquinas) is a Majorcan herbal liqueur made from anise and other aromatic plants such as camomile, fennel, lemon, lemon verbena, marjoram, mint, orange, and rosemary.
Green or amber in colour, it is usually served as a digestif, after a meal. Traditionally, dry and sweet varieties are produced. A mixed blend, or "semi", is also made, to suit modern customer tastes. Some bottles have a dried piece of a plant in them.
A form of the generic Hierbas, Herbs de Majorca has a protected designation of origin and can only be made in Majorca.
A common brand is 'Tunel', first produced in 1898.
