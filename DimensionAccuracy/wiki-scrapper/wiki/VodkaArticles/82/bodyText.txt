Omega-6 fatty acids (also referred to as ω-6 fatty acids or n-6 fatty acids) are a family of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbon-carbon double bond in the n-6 position, that is, the sixth bond, counting from the methyl end.
One review found that an increased intake of omega‐6 fatty acids has been shown to reduce total serum cholesterol and may reduce myocardial infarction. The same review found no significant change in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. A 2021 review found that omega 6 supplements do not affect the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality.
Dietary sources of omega-6 fatty acids include:
poultry
eggs
nuts
hulled sesame seeds
cereals
durum wheat
whole-grain breads
pumpkin seedsVegetable oils are a major source of omega-6 linoleic acid. Worldwide, more than 100 million metric tons of vegetable oils are extracted annually from palm fruits, soybean seeds, rape seeds, and sunflower seeds, providing more than 32 million metric tons of omega-6 linoleic acid and 4 million metric tons of omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid.
The melting point of the fatty acids increases as the number of carbons in the chain increases.
