The Puyuma (Chinese: 卑南族; pinyin: Bēinánzú; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Piu-má cho̍k, Pi-lâm cho̍k), also known as the Pinuyumayan, Peinan or Beinan, are one of the indigenous groups of the Taiwanese aborigines. The people are generally divided into the Chihpen and Nanwang groups, both resident in Taitung County on the east coast of Taiwan.
In the year 2000, the Puyuma numbered 9,606. This was approximately 2.4% of Taiwan's total indigenous population, making them the sixth-largest indigenous group. The Puyuma speak the Puyuma language, as well as Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien.
The name "Puyuma" means "unity" or "concord" and was originally the autonym of the speakers of the Nanwang dialect. Zeitoun and Cauquelin (2006) also note that the word Puyuma can be analyzed as pu'-uma, which means "to send to the field".
