Browns Point is home to the Browns Point Lighthouse, which, although now fully automated, was once fully manned and was first lit on December 12, 1887.
The community is supported by the local Browns Point Improvement Club, which owns much of the land adjacent to the lighthouse. The club is best known in the Pacific Northwest for its fundraiser, the Browns Point Salmon Bake. Started in the 1940s by Browns Point pioneer and Puyallup tribal member Jerry Meeker, the festival is held in the first weekend of August in even-numbered years.
