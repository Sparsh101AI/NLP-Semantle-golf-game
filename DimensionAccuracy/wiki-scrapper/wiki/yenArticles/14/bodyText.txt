Prior to the year 1875, the tical was the currency of Cambodia as well as Siam. However, as a result of French intervention in the region, the tical in Cambodia was replaced in 1875 by the Cambodian franc. The term tical was the name which foreigners used for the local word Baht. The word Baht actually referred to a weight in relation to a weight of silver, since the monetary system was based on the weight of silver coins. The tical (or baht) was a silver coin weighing 15 grams, hence giving it a rough similarity in value to the Indian rupee. The tical was subdivided into 64 att, 32 pe, 8 fuang or 4 salong.
In 1847 and 1848, coins were issued in denominations of 1 att, 1 and 2 pe, 1 fuang, ¼, 1 and 4 tical. The 1 att was struck in copper, the 1 and 2 pe were struck in both copper and billon, the 1 fuang was struck in copper, billon and silver, whilst the ¼, 1 and 4 tical were struck in silver. Many of the smaller coins were uniface.
