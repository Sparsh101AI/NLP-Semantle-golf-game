This is a list of military installations owned or used by the United States Armed Forces currently located in the United States and around the world. This list details only current or recently closed facilities; some defunct facilities are found at Category:Closed military installations of the United States.
An "installation" is defined as "a military base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, including leased space, that is controlled by, or primarily supports DoD's activities. An installation may consist of one or more sites" (geographically-separated real estate parcels).
The United States operates a global network of military installations and is by far the largest operator of military bases abroad with locations in dozens of nations on every continent, with 38 "named bases" having active-duty, National Guard, reserve, or civilian personnel as of September 30, 2014. Its largest, in terms of personnel, is Ramstein Air Base, in Germany, with almost 9,200 personnel. The Pentagon stated in 2013 that there are "around" 5,000 bases total, with "around" 600 of them overseas. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject there is no comprehensive list of detailed information on the exact number or location of all bases, stations and installations as it involves highly classified information.  The total number of foreign sites for installations and facilities that are either in active use and service or may be activated and operated and by American military personnel and allies is at just over 1,000.

NiameyThere were approximately 1,500–2,000 U.S. Marine and Special Operations Forces in Syria, spread across 12 different facilities, being used as training bases for Kurdish rebels. These soldiers withdrew from Syria to western Iraq in October 2019. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported that the Pentagon was planning to "leave 150 Special Operations forces at a base called al-Tanf", where the United States is training Free Syrian Army rebels. In addition, 200 U.S. soldiers would remain in eastern Syria near the oil fields, to prevent the Islamic State, Syrian government and Russian forces from advancing in the region.
According to the Head of the Syrian Arab Republic delegation to Astana talks the US presence in Syria is "illegal" and "without the consent of (the) government".
This is a list of links for U.S. Army forts and installations, organized by U.S. state or territory within the U.S. and by country if overseas.  For consistency, major Army National Guard (ARNG) training facilities are included but armory locations are not.
