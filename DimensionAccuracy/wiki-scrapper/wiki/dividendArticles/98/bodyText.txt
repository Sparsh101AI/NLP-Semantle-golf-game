In mathematical logic, a ground term of a formal system is a term that does not contain any variables. Similarly, a ground formula is a formula that does not contain any variables.
In first-order logic with identity, the sentence 



Q
(
a
)
∨
P
(
b
)


{\displaystyle Q(a)\lor P(b)}

 is a ground formula, with 



a


{\displaystyle a}

 and 



b


{\displaystyle b}

 being constant symbols. A ground expression is a ground term or ground formula.
Consider the following expressions in first order logic over a signature containing a constant symbol 



0


{\displaystyle 0}

 for the number 



0
,


{\displaystyle 0,}

 a unary function symbol 



s


{\displaystyle s}

 for the successor function and a binary function symbol 



+


{\displaystyle +}

 for addition.

{\displaystyle s(0),s(s(0)),s(s(s(0))),\ldots }

 are ground terms,




x

s
(

)


{\displaystyle x+s(1)}

 and 



s
(
x
)


{\displaystyle s(x)}

 are terms, but not ground terms,




s
(
0
)
=
1


{\displaystyle s(0)=1}

 and 



0
+
0
=
0


{\displaystyle 0+0=0}

 are ground formulae,What follows is a formal definition for first-order languages. Let a first-order language be given, with 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 the set of constant symbols, 



V


{\displaystyle V}

 the set of (individual) variables, 



F


{\displaystyle F}

 the set of functional operators, and 



P


{\displaystyle P}

 the set of predicate symbols.
A ground term is a term that contains no variables. Ground terms may be defined by logical recursion (formula-recursion):
Elements of 



C


{\displaystyle C}

 are ground terms;
If 



f
∈
F


{\displaystyle f\in F}

 is an 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-ary function symbol and 




α

α

α

n




{\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}}

 are ground terms, then 



f

(

)



{\displaystyle f\left(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}\right)}

 is a ground term.
Every ground term can be given by a finite application of the above two rules (there are no other ground terms; in particular, predicates cannot be ground terms).Roughly speaking, the Herbrand universe is the set of all ground terms.
A ground predicate, ground atom or ground literal is an atomic formula all of whose argument terms are ground terms.
If 



p
∈
P


{\displaystyle p\in P}

 is an 



n


{\displaystyle n}

-ary predicate symbol and 




α

α

…

α

{\displaystyle \alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}}

 are ground terms, then

)



{\displaystyle p\left(\alpha _{1},\alpha _{2},\ldots ,\alpha _{n}\right)}

 is a ground predicate or ground atom.
Roughly speaking, the Herbrand base is the set of all ground atoms, while a Herbrand interpretation assigns a truth value to each ground atom in the base.
A ground formula or ground clause is a formula without variables.
Formulas with free variables may be defined by syntactic recursion as follows:
The free variables of an unground atom are all variables occurring in it.
The free variables of 



¬
p


{\displaystyle \lnot p}

 are the same as those of 



p
.


{\displaystyle p.}

 The free variables of 



p
∨
q
,
p
∧
q
,
p
→
q


{\displaystyle p\lor q,p\land q,p\to q}

 are those free variables of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 or free variables of 



q
.


{\displaystyle q.}


The free variables of 



∀
x

p


{\displaystyle \forall x\;p}

 and 



∃
x

p


{\displaystyle \exists x\;p}

 are the free variables of 



p


{\displaystyle p}

 except 



x
.
