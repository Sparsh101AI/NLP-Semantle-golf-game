Campeonato Paranaense, which has been contested since 1915, is the top-flight football league of the state of Paraná, Brazil.
The format has changed in 2014. 12 teams are together in a single group. They play against each other once, and the 8 best teams after the 11 games will play the knockout phase that teams will play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis.
The last 4 teams will play the Torneio da Morte, where they will play against each other two times (home-away), the best two teams will stay in the Série Ouro, the first division of the football of the state and the two worst will be relegated to the Série Prata, the second division.
The best four teams will ensure place in the 2015 Copa do Brasil and the two best that won't play in any division of the 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro will ensure place in the 2014 Campeonato Brasileiro Série D.
