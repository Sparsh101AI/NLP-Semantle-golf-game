 
The FINA World Swimming Championships (25m) or "Short Course Worlds" as they are sometimes known, is an international swimming competition. It is swum in a short course (25m) pool, and has been held in the years when FINA has not held its main World Championships (currently this means in even years).
Unlike the FINA World Aquatics Championships, this championship is swimming-only (the World Championships feature all 5 Aquatics disciplines), and is contested in a short course, 25-meter pool (rather than a long course, 50-meter pool).
There are men's and women's events in all four strokes, the individual medley, as well as in relays. There are also two mixed relays.
