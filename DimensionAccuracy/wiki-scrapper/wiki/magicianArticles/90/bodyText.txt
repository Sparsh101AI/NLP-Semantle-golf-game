In 1975, a license was given for a new station on 93.9 FM in El Paso, KPAS. "94FM" was El Paso's original rock station but changed away from the format in 1981, chasing listeners toward KLAQ at 95.5. Prior to Spanish-language programing, this station also aired Hot AC and CHR formats.
For the first time, in 1992, KPAS became KINT-FM. On March 18, 1994, the station changed its call sign to KSVE, only to revert to KINT-FM on May 20 of that year.
Originally owned by El Paso Broadcasting Corporation, the station sometime in the 1990s was sold to its current owner, Santa Monica-based Entravision Communications
Spanish-language programming began in 1994 with the original "La Caliente" format (also formerly occupied by an unrelated radio station XEJUA-AM, which flipped to La Lupe in 2020, leaving the brand completely out of the area) which broadcast Tejano music between 1994 and 1998; by then, the branding flipped to a Mexican Regional Top 40 format. That branding ended in 2007 in favor of Spanish-language variety AC "Jos√© FM" format, which ended on January 8, 2018 in favor of "La Suavecita" format, returning the Mexican Regional music to this station, this time as a Mexican Regional AC.
