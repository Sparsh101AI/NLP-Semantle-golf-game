Pembroke Lakes Mall, often referred to as Pines Mall or Pembroke Lakes, is an enclosed shopping mall located in Pembroke Pines, Florida, a suburb of Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Located on the intersection of State Road 820 (Pines Boulevard) and State Road 823 (Flamingo Road), it is in between Interstate 75 and Florida's Turnpike. Owned and managed by Brookfield Properties Retail Group, the mall was opened in 1992, and has 1,135,374 square feet (105,479.7 m) on one floor. As of 2018, Pembroke Lakes is one of South Florida's most popular malls. The anchor stores are Round One Entertainment, AMC Theatres, 2 Dillard's stores, JCPenney, and 2 Macy's stores.
 After a planned fall 1991 opening, the mall opened to the public on October 28, 1992 as the third final Homart property, with a 181,847 sq ft (16,894.1 m) Burdines, an 80,823 sq ft (7,508.7 m) Mervyn's (both opened on September 19), a 141,751 sq ft (13,169.1 m) Sears (opened September 29), and a 147,760 sq ft (13,727 m) J. C. Penney (which also opened another at Miami International Mall) as anchors. Just like Pompano Fashion Square also in Broward County, Mervyn's was the only single level anchor store while Burdines, JCPenney, and Sears had 2 levels.
The JCPenney and Burdines stores in the mall replaced their stores at Hollywood Fashion Center while Sears relocated from the Hollywood Mall. A 157,473 sq ft (14,629.7 m) Dillard's later filled the fifth anchor pad between Sears and the main entrance as a fourth multi-level store. This was their second location in South Florida (the first was at The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale), and opened on August 16, 1995; the store opened almost three years after the other 4 anchors. This was likewise done at North Point Mall a year later, while stores also opened at the newly opened Seminole Towne Center and Lakeline Mall during this time (Another area store at The Mall at Wellington Green eventually opened within that mall in 2001). Only two years later, in 1997, Dillard's converted the Mervyn's store into a second location, housing the men's and home departments, thus reconfiguring their existing store to house ladies and children's clothing.
Burdines merged with Macy's in 2003 and then became simply Macy's in 2005, housing women's and kid's clothing. Shortly thereafter, in 2006, Macy's would also fill the sixth anchor pad as a second location for their men's and home departments. This 70,000 sq ft (6,500 m) single level store was built between the food court and original Macy's. A four-story parking garage was also added next to both Macy's stores.
In 2016, GGP announced that the mall's Sears shrunk to 101,621 sq ft (9,440.9 m) make room for a 40,130 sq ft (3,728 m) square foot AMC movie theater, which opened in 2017. Sears closed on September 15, 2019. In Q3 2019, Round One Entertainment announced that a new location would open in Pembroke Lakes Mall with an original opening date of Spring 2021, in the former Sears vacant anchor store, making it the first and only Round1 in the State of Florida. Due to the ongoing pandemic, construction was severely delayed. Round One Entertainment officially opened to the public on June 11, 2022.
Round1 Entertainment is open as of June 11, 2022.
