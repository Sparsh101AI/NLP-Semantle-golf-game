TheGrio, styled as thegrio, is an American digital television channel and website with news, opinion, entertainment and video content geared toward African Americans.
Originally launched in June 2009 as a division of NBC News, it became a division of MSNBC in 2013. It was founded by the team who created the documentary film Meeting David Wilson. In 2014, it was sold to its founders. In June 2016, Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios acquired the site. The TV channel was founded as Light TV in 2016, and was relaunched as TheGrio TV in January 2021.
TheGrio's editorial mandate is to "focus on news and events that have a unique interest and pronounced impact within the national African Americans audience," offering what co-founder and Executive Editor David Wilson feels "are underrepresented in existing national news outlets".
The website's name is derived from the word griot, the term for a West African oral historian and storyteller.

With MGM purchasing Hearst and Burnett and Downey's shares in UAMG, the channel was still a planned streaming service. However, Hearst and Burnett and Downey retained their stakes in the channel.
MGM announced the formation of Light TV on December 15, 2015, with a launch planned for December on thirteen major market stations owned by Fox Television Stations. The network launched on January 20, 2016 with two stations, and the rest of the group's stations.
Light TV was sold by MGM TV in October 2020 to the Allen Media Group division of Entertainment Studios, along with its movie-oriented sister channel This TV. On December 3, 2020, it was announced that the network would be relaunched as TheGrio.TV on January 15, 2021, carrying lifestyle and entertainment programming of interest to the African American community. It was an extension of the Entertainment Studios-owned website TheGrio.
On or after that date, Entertainment Studios stopped feeding Light TV programming to some of the network's affiliates (mainly those associated with Fox Television Stations), leaving a test pattern card promoting TheGrio.TV's upcoming launch, though MGM continues to feature a live stream of Light TV on its website, suggesting only the satellite transponder for Light TV was sold to Entertainment Studios; some affiliates have thus taken the subchannel dark due to a current lack of programming on that satellite space. FTS confirmed on December 9 that it would indeed carry TheGrio.TV on its stations when it launched on January 15, 2021.
Light TV featured several series and movies meant to fit the network's family-oriented approach, including content from the MGM film and TV library or acquired through outside sources. Infomercials were added to the Light TV lineup in 2019, occupying all of the overnight hours and into the early morning.
