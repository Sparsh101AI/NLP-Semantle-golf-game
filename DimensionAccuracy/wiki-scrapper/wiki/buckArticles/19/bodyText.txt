Arriva Rail London is a train operating company owned by Arriva UK Trains that operates the London Overground concession on behalf of Transport for London.
In April 2015, Transport for London placed a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, inviting expressions of interest in operating the next concession. In July 2015, Transport for London announced the shortlisted bidders for the next concession were Arriva UK Trains, ComfortDelGro, Govia and MTR Corporation.
In March 2016, Arriva was awarded a seven-and-a-half-year concession with an option to extend for a further two years. Operations commenced on 13 November 2016. Arriva held a 50% shareholding in the previous concession holder, London Overground Rail Operations.

Arriva Rail London inherited a fleet of Class 172, Class 315, Class 317 and Class 378s. From 2019, the first of 54 Class 710s will be delivered. These will replace the Class 172, Class 315 and Class 317s, and the Class 378s on Watford DC line duties allowing them to be concentrated on North London line, East London line, West London line and South London line services.
On 22 May 2019 TfL announced that approval had been gained for the Class 710s to enter passenger service.
