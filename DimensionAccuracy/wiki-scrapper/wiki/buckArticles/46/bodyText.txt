The 19th annual International Emmy Awards took place on November 25, 1991, Roger Moore was host of the ceremony at the New York Hilton, which was telecast on the A&E channel, a cable network, on 28 December. The award was displayed in over 20 countries, including Italy, Germany, Australia, Spain, Japan and China.
This year's entries – 242 from 24 nations – were judged in New York City and Los Angeles by U.S.-based TV executives, distributors, buyers, producers, writers and directors. To ensure that programs are not judged on production values alone, judges are instructed to consider the concept behind a show as well as the execution.
The International Emmy Awards are given by the International Council of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Of the 18 programs nominated in six categories, 14 were English-language, including all of the nominees in three categories: arts documentary, popular arts, and programs for children and young people. The other categories are drama, documentary, and performing arts.
Shows produced in the United Kingdom accounted for 10 of the 18 nominations. Three Australian programs were nominated, as well as two from Canada and one each from France, Spain and Germany.
The awards ceremony was produced by Joseph Cates and sold by Warner Bros., and broadcast by Italian web RAI.
In addition, special awards were given to Henry P. Becton Jr., president and general manager of the WGBH Foundation in Boston, who received the International Council's Directorate Award, and documentary producer Adrian Cowell, who was given the Founder's Award.
