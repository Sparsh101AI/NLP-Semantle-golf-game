Guanghan (simplified Chinese: 广汉; traditional Chinese: 廣漢; pinyin: Guǎnghàn; formerly known as Hanchow) is a county-level city under the administration of Deyang in Sichuan province, southwest China,  and only 23 kilometres (14 miles) from Chengdu. The predominant industries are tourism, pharmaceuticals and the supply of building material.
Guanghan has an area of 538 km (208 sq mi), a population of 590,000, with urban population of 170,000. A major part of the tourism is the nearby Sanxingdui ruins. The striking exhibits at the Sanxingdui Museum highlight archaeological finds that some Chinese archaeologists regard as even more important than the Terracotta Army.
The region is steadily becoming more industrialised and that is helping with the progression of agriculture and enhances the region's development.
Civil Aviation Flight University of China (CAFUC) is famous for educating the dominant majority of Chinese civil aviation pilots and air traffic controllers.
