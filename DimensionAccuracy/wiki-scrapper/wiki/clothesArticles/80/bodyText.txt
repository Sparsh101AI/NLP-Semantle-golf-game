The Joint Working Group (JWG) was the first official bilateral administrative mechanism formed post the 1962 boundary war by India and China to discuss the boundary question with the aim of finding a solution. It was officially announced in a joint press communique in Beijing on 23 December 1988. A total of fifteen meetings of the JWG were held between 1989 and 2005. The last meeting was held on 30–31 March 2005. 
While the JWG was not able to resolve the boundary question, it was an important bilateral mechanism through which India and China gradually resolved certain aspects of the border problem. A "hotline" was set up between military commanders, border posts were opened, mechanisms for conveying troop positions were just some of the incremental changes accomplished.
The relevant part of the joint press communique reads:
The JWG would be led by the Indian foreign secretary and the Chinese deputy foreign minister. The JWG had a three-point mandate, summarized as, make recommendations and maintain border peace pending a final solution utilizing the expertise of military experts, communications experts, legal experts etc.
