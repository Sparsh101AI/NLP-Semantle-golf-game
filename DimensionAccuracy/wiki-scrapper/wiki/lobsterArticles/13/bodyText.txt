A chipolata (/ˌtʃɪpəˈlɑːtə/) is a type of fresh sausage, likely created in France. Sausages by that name appear in the 1903 edition of Escoffier's Le guide culinaire. Chipolatas are often prepared as a relatively thin and short sausage.
Chipolatas are typically made from coarse-ground pork seasoned with salt and pepper together with herbs and spices—according to the particular recipe—such as sage, thyme, pimento, or nutmeg. The word is French and probably derives from the Italian cipollata, which essentially means "made with onions" and according to some sources may have referred to an onion stew with sausages.
Chipolatas are common in the United Kingdom. They frequently appear as part of a Christmas dinner wrapped in streaky bacon as pigs in blankets.
A garniture à la chipolata consists of onions, chipolata sausages, chestnuts, salt pork, and sometimes carrots in a demiglace or Madeira sauce.
In Switzerland, the Italian spelling cipollata is more prevalent. The sausage also usually contains veal and milk, in addition to pork. Cipollata are fried or grilled and often served to children. Cipollata taste and look like a miniature version of the St. Galler Bratwurst.
