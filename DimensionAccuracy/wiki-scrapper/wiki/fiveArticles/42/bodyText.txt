A multimodal logic is a modal logic that has more than one primitive modal operator. They find substantial applications in theoretical computer science.
A modal logic with n primitive unary modal operators 




◻

i


,
i

{
1

…

}


{\displaystyle \Box _{i},i\in \{1,\ldots ,n\}}

 is called an n-modal logic. Given these operators and negation, one can always add 




◊

i




{\displaystyle \Diamond _{i}}

 modal operators defined as 




◊

i


P


{\displaystyle \Diamond _{i}P}

 if and only if

{\displaystyle \lnot \Box _{i}\lnot P}

.
Perhaps the first substantive example of a two-modal logic is Arthur Prior's tense logic, with two modalities, F and P, corresponding to "sometime in the future" and "sometime in the past". A logic with infinitely many modalities is dynamic logic, introduced by Vaughan Pratt in 1976 and having a separate modal operator for every regular expression. A version of temporal logic introduced in 1977 and intended for program verification has two modalities, corresponding to dynamic logic's [A] and [A*] modalities for a single program A, understood as the whole universe taking one step forwards in time. The term multimodal logic itself was not introduced until 1980. Another example of a multimodal logic is the Hennessy–Milner logic, itself a fragment of the more expressive modal μ-calculus, which is also a fixed-point logic.
Multimodal logic can be used also to formalize a kind of knowledge representation: the motivation of epistemic logic is allowing several agents (they are regarded as subjects capable of forming beliefs, knowledge); and managing  the belief or knowledge of each agent, so that epistemic assertions can be formed about them. The modal operator 



◻


{\displaystyle \Box }

 must be capable of bookkeeping the cognition of each agent,  thus 




◻

i




{\displaystyle \Box _{i}}

 must be indexed on the set of the agents. The motivation is that 




◻

i


α


{\displaystyle \Box _{i}\alpha }

 should assert "The subject i has knowledge about 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

 being true". But it can be used also for formalizing "the subject i believes 



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }

". For formalization of meaning based on the possible world semantics approach, a multimodal generalization of Kripke semantics can be used: instead of a single "common" accessibility relation, there is a series of them indexed on the set of agents.
