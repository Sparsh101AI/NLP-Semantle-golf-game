The Usatovo culture is a late variant of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture, which flourished northwest of the Black Sea from 3500 BC to 3000 BC.
The Usatovo culture appears to be a mixture of Neolithic elements of Southeast Europe, with intrusive cultures from the Pontic steppe. From native Neolithic elements, it shares flat graves, figurines, and painted ceramics, while it shares tumulus burials, horses, and shell-tempered coarse wares with steppe cultures. It also displays metallic items, such as arsenical bronze and silver, which suggests contacts with the North Caucasus.
Within the Kurgan hypothesis, the Usatovo culture represents the domination of native Cucuteni–Trypillia agriculturalists by Indo-European peoples from the steppe. According to Anthony, the roots of the pre-Germanic languages lay in the Usatovo culture.
