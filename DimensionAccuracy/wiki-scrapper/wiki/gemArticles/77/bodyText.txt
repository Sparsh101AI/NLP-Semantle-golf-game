General elections were held in Paraguay on 9 February 1958. At the time, the Colorado Party was the only legally permitted party. As such, incumbent president Alfredo Stroessner was unopposed for a full term; he had been in office since 1954 by virtue of winning a special election for the remainder of Federico Ch√°vez' second term.
