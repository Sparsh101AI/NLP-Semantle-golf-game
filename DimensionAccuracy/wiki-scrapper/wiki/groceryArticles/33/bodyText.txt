The North Shore (French: Rive-Nord) is the general term for the northern suburbs of Montreal. The North Shore is located in southwestern Quebec on the northern shores of the Rivière des Prairies and the Rivière des Mille Îles, opposite the Island of Montreal and Île Jésus (the city of Laval). It consists of twenty municipalities that belong to the Laurentides and Lanaudière administrative regions. While the city of Laval is commonly associated with the North Shore, it is not considered part of the North Shore because of its status as an island.
