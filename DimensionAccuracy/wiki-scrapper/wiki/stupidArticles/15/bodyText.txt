East Africa Time, or EAT, is a time zone used in eastern Africa. The time zone is three hours ahead of UTC (UTC+03:00), which is the same as Moscow Time, Arabia Standard Time, Further-eastern European Time and Eastern European Summer Time.
As this time zone is predominantly in the equatorial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year and so daylight saving time is not observed.
