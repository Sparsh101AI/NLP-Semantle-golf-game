The following are the baseball events of the year 1922  throughout the world.
World Series: New York Giants over New York Yankees (4-0-1)

This was the third of twelve seasons of the first Negro National League. Generally, teams did not play a uniform number of games (since some teams barnstormed against other Negro baseball teams). This sometimes created a difference in who would generally be considered first place in certain years. Playoffs would not be held to determine a winner until 1925 (for which it would be used five times until 1930). For example, Indianapolis played the most games with 85, followed by Kansas City at eighty, Detroit with 74, and Chicago with 62. The latter team with its superior winning percentage among the group is generally considered the pennant winner.
A loose confederation of teams were gathered in the East to compete with the West, however East teams did not organize a formal league as the West did.
