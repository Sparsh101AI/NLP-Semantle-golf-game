Archie Burdette Ward (December 27, 1896 – July 9, 1955) was an American journalist who served as sports editor for the Chicago Tribune. He was the creator of the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and the Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament.
Ward was born in 1896 in Irwin, Illinois, and attended Columbia Academy and Columbia College (now Loras College) in Dubuque, Iowa. He worked for the Telegraph Herald in Dubuque in 1919. Ward completed college at the University of Notre Dame, where he worked as publicity director under Knute Rockne in 1919 and 1920, before graduating in 1921. Ward then worked for the Star in Rockford, Illinois, during 1921–1925. He joined the Chicago Tribune in 1925, and became sports editor in 1930.
Ward created the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, the Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament, and the College All-Star Football Classic (an annual game between professional and college players). In 1941, he was offered the role of Commissioner of the National Football League (NFL), but turned it down. He later started the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC).
Ward published several collections of light content ("notes, verses and comments") from the Chicago Tribune entitled In The Wake Of The News Book, and edited an anthology called The Greatest Sports Stories From Chicago Tribune. He also was the author of three sports-related books:
Frank Leahy and the Fighting Irish (1944)
The Green Bay Packers (1946)
The New Chicago White Sox (1951)Ward was involved in conservative political causes and as well as the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Described as affable and mild mannered, he was considered a dynamo with powerful contacts in American politics, church matters, and journalism. Ward died in his sleep in 1955, aged 58, at his home on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago; his death was attributed to a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Helen, and a son; a daughter had predeceased him in 1940. His funeral took place the same day as the 1955 MLB All-Star Game.
