The 2014–15 Los Angeles Kings season was the 48th season (47th season of play) for the National Hockey League franchise that was established on June 5, 1967. The Kings failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team since the 2006–07 Carolina Hurricanes to fail to qualify for the playoffs after winning the Stanley Cup the previous season.
The team entered the regular season as the defending champions. Having won two Stanley Cup championships in the last three years, the Kings entered were the early favorites to retain their title. Again, however, Los Angeles' post-championship home opener was a defeat, this time a 4–0 blowout to cross-state rival San Jose Sharks. The following game was an overtime defeat to the Arizona Coyotes, followed by a home win against the Winnipeg Jets. During the season, the Kings took part in their second outdoor game, this time visiting the Sharks at Levi's Stadium for the 2015 NHL Stadium Series. The Kings struggled often during the season, with scoring slumps, defensemen losing games to injury and suspensions and frequent road losses. LA Kings at least had a lackluster of play. But the end of the season, they were caught and missed the playoffs by two points.
