The Nova Scotia Junior Hockey League (formerly the Nova Scotia Junior B Hockey League) is a Junior "B" ice hockey league in Nova Scotia, Canada, sanctioned by Hockey Canada.  The winner of the Nova Scotia playoffs competes for the Don Johnson Cup, the Atlantic Junior "B" Crown.
The Mainland Junior B Hockey League was formed in 1980 by Al Hollingsworth.  In 1992, it took on the Cape Breton Jr. Mills and the Port Hawkesbury Pirates of the folded Cape Breton Junior B Hockey League (also known as the Eastern or Northumberland League) and was renamed the Nova Scotia Junior B Hockey League.  In 2006, the league dropped the "B" from its name.
