Brigasc is a dialect of the Ligurian language. It is spoken in Italy and France.
The Brigasc dialect is spoken in La Brigue (France) and Briga Alta (Italy) and some villages of the communes of Ormea and Triora. It is very close to Royasc dialect.
During the Renaissance the Ligurian language was spoken in all the territories of the Republic of Genoa: in the western area of this republic one of its groups (spoken mainly in the area between the Principality of Monaco and Sanremo) was called Intemelio.
The language spoken in the mountains around Briga was called Brigasc and received some influence from the Occitan language.
