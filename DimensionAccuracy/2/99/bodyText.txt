Kings Mountain is a small suburban city within the Charlotte metropolitan area in Cleveland and Gaston counties, North Carolina, United States. Most of the city is in Cleveland County, with a small eastern portion in Gaston County.  The population was 10,296 at the 2010 census.  During the Revolutionary War, Patriot militia defeated Loyalist militia in the Battle of Kings Mountain.
Originally the settlement was called White Plains, but the city was incorporated on October 16, 1874, and the name was changed. It was decided that "Kings Mountain" would be a more appropriate name since the community was close to the site of the historic 1780 Battle of Kings Mountain in York County, South Carolina, a turning point in the American Revolutionary War.
The Battle of Kings Mountain was proclaimed as "the turning point of the American Revolution" by Thomas Jefferson. Liberty Mountain, a play performed at the local theater, recounts the events of the battle. The downtown area is home to the museum, police station, and the Mauney Memorial Library.
The Central School Historic District, King Street Overhead Bridge, Margrace Mill Village Historic District, Jacob S. Mauney Memorial Library and Teacher's Home, Southern Railway Company Overhead Bridge, and West End Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
